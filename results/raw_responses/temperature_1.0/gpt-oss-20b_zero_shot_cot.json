A syllogism that enables such a scenario is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Logical structure (mood & figure)\n\nPremises: **A** (\u201cAll B are Z\u201d), **A** (\u201cAll G are B\u201d).  \nConclusion: **O** (\u201cSome Z are not G\u201d).\n\nThis is an **AA\u2013O** syllogism. According to the classical syllogistic rules (Aristotle, Czecheny, etc.), an AA\u2011O construction is never valid; the middle term alone cannot establish the existence of elements outside the minor term.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Summary\n\nBecause the premises only establish **directional containment** (Glorps \u2192 Blargs \u2192 Zimons), they do **not** allow us to deduce that there exist any zimons lacking glorp status.

Here the conclusion asserts a *co\u2011occurrence* (\u2203\\(C\\) \u2227 \\(S\\)) that is expressly forbidden by Premise\u202f1.\n\nFormally, the conclusion is **illicit**: it is not *deduced* from the premises because the premises leave no logical path to \u201csome mushrooms are fruits.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4.

This counter\u2011example demonstrates that the syllogism is logically **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom line\n\nBecause the conclusion \u201csome mushrooms are fruits\u201d contradicts what the premises already state (no fruit can be a fungus, and all mushrooms are fungi), the syllogism does **not** follow.

Then:  \n   - Every mushroom is a fungus.  \n   - No fruit is a fungus.  \n   Consequently, a mushroom cannot be a fruit.  \n\n   Therefore the possibility that \u201csome mushrooms are fruits\u201d is mathematically impossible under the premises\u2014unless the premises themselves were false, which they are assumed to be true in a syllogistic argument.\n\n3. **Venn diagram intuition**  \n   Imagine a Venn diagram with two circles: **Fungi** (inside) = mushrooms, **Fruits** (outside). The two circles do **not** overlap. The conclusion would require an overlap, which cannot exist.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Premises**: \u201cAll mushrooms are fungi\u201d (A\u2011statement) and \u201cNo fruits are fungi\u201d (E\u2011statement).  \n- **Conclusion**: \u201cSome mushrooms are fruits\u201d (I\u2011statement of existence).  \n\nBecause the premises entail that mushrooms and fruits are disjoint, the conclusion must be false. Hence, the syllogism is **incorrect (invalid)**.\n\nFeel free to ask if you\u2019d like a deeper dive into categorical logic rules or a diagrammatic illustration!",

That satisfies the distribution rule.\n\n### 3.

Since no wuggles overlap with flibberts, **no zorph can be a wuggle**.\n\nTherefore the assertion in the conclusion \u2014\n\n> *Some zorphs are wuggles*  \n\n\u2014 contradicts the combined premises. \n\nIn terms of categorical logic:\n\n- Premise\u202f1: \u2200x (W(x) \u2192 \u00acF(x))\n- Premise\u202f2: \u2200x (Z(x) \u2192 F(x))\n- From these, we can infer \u2200x (Z(x) \u2192 \u00acW(x)).  \n- The conclusion claims \u2203x (Z(x) \u2227 W(x)), which directly contradicts the inferred statement.\n\nThus, the argument is **invalid** (it fails the proof by contradiction\u2014they don't match).\n\n### 4.

For a valid syllogism, the conclusion\u2019s **subject** must be distributed if the subject is distributed in any premise. The subject *zorphs* is **not** distributed in Premise\u202f2 (A). The conclusion *some zorphs are wuggles* distributes *zorphs* (the subject), violating the rule that you cannot distribute a term that was never distributed in any premise.\n\nTherefore, the syllogism fails at the **distribution** of the subject in the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe conclusion *\u201csome zorphs are wuggles\u201d* is **not logically implied by the premises**; it contradicts them.

From this we can *only* deduce the following:\n\n- If something is a blirnic place, then it is crundle.\n- If something is **not** a crundle, then it is **not** a blirnic place.\n- But we cannot reverse the implication: *Being crundle does **not** guarantee* being a blirnic place.\n\nFormally, the inference attempts to go from \\(\\forall x\\, (Bx \\rightarrow Cx)\\) and \\(Cx\\) to \\(\\,Bx\\).  \nThis step is invalid; the antecedent \\(Cx\\) alone is not enough to establish \\(Bx\\).\n\n---\n\n### Quick check in syllogistic terms\n| Premise | Type (standard form) | Syllogistic Fig. |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------|\n| All blirnic places are crundle | A \u2013 \u201cAll B are C\u201d | 1 |\n| Fizzle is crundle | A* \u2013 \u201cSome C\u201d | 2 |\n| **Conclusion** | A* \u2013 \u201cSome B\u201d | 3 |\n\nThis is an **A\\_1 \u2013 A\\_2 \u2013 A\\_3** case, but the morphological form A\\_1 \u2013 A\\_2 \u2013 A\\_3 is *not* a valid mood in standard Aristotle (it would require a particular assumption about the universal, which we don\u2019t have).

The rule \u201cif **all** B are C, then **any** C must be B\u201d is simply false.\n\n---\n\n### Why the inference fails\n\n1. **Missing contraposition**  \n   The premise tells us that being a `blirnic place` guarantees being a `crundle`.  \n   It does **not** tell us that *being a crundle* guarantees being a `blirnic place`.  \n   Thus we cannot \u201creverse\u201d the implication.\n\n2. **Counter\u2011example**  \n   Choose any real\u2011world categories that fit the pattern:\n\n   * **Interpretation 1**  \n     - All **squares** are **shapes**.  \n     - **Fizzle** is a **shape**.  \n     - Is **Fizzle** a **square**? **No** \u2013 it might be a circle, triangle, etc.\n\n   * **Interpretation 2**  \n     - All **blirnic places** are **crundle**.  \n     - (Imagine \"blirnic places\" = \u201cChristmas lights\u201d and \u201ccrundle\u201d = \u201cbright\u201d).  \n     - \u201cFizzle\u201d is bright (maybe a neon sign), but that does **not** make it a Christmas light.\n\n   The premises can both be true while the conclusion is false, proving the form is invalid.\n\n3. **Categorical syllogism test**  \n   In a proper categorical syllogism, the *middle term* (here \u201ccrundle\u201d) **must be distributed** in at least one premise.  \n   - Premise\u202f1: \u201cAll B are C\u201d \u2192 predicate C is **not** distributed.  \n   - Premise\u202f2: \u201cD is C\u201d \u2192 predicate C is also **not** distributed.  \n\n   Since \u201ccrundle\u201d is never distributed, the syllogism violates the basic rules (the conclusion cannot introduce a non\u2011distributed term).  \n\n4. **Affirming the consequent**  \n   The logical form is:  \n   ```\n   If B then C\n   C\n   \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 (invalid)\n   Therefore B\n   ```  \n   This is the classic \u201caffirmation of the consequent\u201d fallacy.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nBecause it misuses the universal statement (\u201cAll X are Y\u201d) and wrongly assumes that all Y belong to X, the syllogism cannot be accepted as correct.  \n\n**Verdict:** *Incorrect (invalid).*",

Conclusion\n\nBecause the middle term \u201ccrundle\u201d is **undistributed** in both premises, the syllogism violates a fundamental rule of categorical logic.

It never appears as a subject. |\n| **3. Figure & Mood identification** | The figure (the arrangement of terms) must be one of the four standard figures, and the mood (the combination of the proposition types) must match a valid form for that figure. | The middle\u2011term violation immediately precludes the argument from fitting any of the four figures. Consequently, no valid mood confirms the conclusion from the given premises. |\n\nBecause the middle term violates the essential rule, the syllogism cannot be reduced to any of the accepted standard forms (e.g., Barbara, Celarent, Darii, etc.).

From (1) and (2) it follows that *C* cannot be *A*, so the existential statement in (3) is false.\n\n- **Fallacy types**: It resembles the *illicit conversion* or *affirming the consequent* error, but fundamentally it violates the *law of non\u2011contradiction*.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n> **Incorrect**.

Verify the syllogistic **figure** and **mood**\n\nA classical categorical syllogism is valid only when it has the correct *mood* (type of each premise + conclusion) and *figure* (order of terms).  \n\nFor our case:\n\n| Term | Position | Declaration |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| **S** | Subject of conclusion | \u201csnorfs\u201d |\n| **P** | Predicate of conclusion | \u201czooping grinks\u201d |\n| **M** | Middle term | \u201cplimbles\u201d |\n\nIn the standard notation the premises must appear as:\n\n1. **Major Premise:** M\u202f\u2013\u202fP   (the middle term is the subject, the conclusion\u2019s predicate is the predicate)  \n2. **Minor Premise:** S\u202f\u2013\u202fM   (the conclusion\u2019s subject is the subject, the middle term is the predicate)  \n\nBut our premises read:\n\n1. All\u202fZ are\u202fM  (All\u202fP are\u202fM)  \n2. No\u202fS are\u202fM   (No\u202fS are\u202fM)\n\nObserve that **Premise\u202f1 is the opposite of the required \u201cmajor\u201d form**. It has the predicate of the conclusion (P) as the subject and M as the predicate. This is an *illicit ordering* \u2013 the syllogism violates the strict structural rule of figure\u202f1 (or any figure, for that matter).\n\nBecause of this violation, we cannot even treat the syllogism as a standard categorical in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Logical consequence (a quick semantic test)\n\nEven abandoning the formal structure, we can test whether the premises entail the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1:** If you\u2019re a zooping grit (Z), you have plimbles (M).  \n2. **Premise\u202f2:** If you\u2019re a snorf (S), you do **not** have plimbles (\u00acM).\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that *some* snorf **is** a zooping grin:\n\n- Being a snorf \u2192 \u00acM (from Premise\u202f2)  \n- Being a zooping grin \u2192 M (from Premise\u202f1)  \n\nAn entity cannot simultaneously satisfy both \u00acM and M. Hence the assumption \u201csome snorfs are zooping grinks\u201d leads to a contradiction. Therefore the conclusion cannot logically follow from the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Implicit existential import\n\nBoth premises are universal statements (A and E). Classical Aristotelian logic bestows **no existential import** on such premises: from \u201cAll\u202fZ are\u202fM\u201d one cannot infer that any Z exist. Since the conclusion is a **particular affirmative** (\u201cSome\u202fS are\u202fZ\u201d), it inherently claims existence of an S that is also a Z. The premises give no basis for that existence claim.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom line\n\n- **Structural violation:** The premises are not arranged in the required order (major\u2011minor positions).  \n- **Logical contradiction:** The premises together actually *exclude* the possibility of any S being Z.  \n- **Existential import:** The premises do not assert that any Z exist.\n\nTherefore, the argument does **not** make a valid inference.\n\n**Conclusion: The syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**",

The premises allow two coherent possibilities:\n\n* **No snorfs at all** \u2013 (the universal \u201cNo S are M\u201d is trivially true).\n* **No zooping grinks at all** \u2013 (the universal \u201cAll P are M\u201d is also trivially true).\n* **Both sets exist but are disjoint** \u2013 e.g., there are snorfs that do *not* have plimbles and zooping grinks that *do* have plimbles, with no element in common.\n\nIn any of these scenarios the premises hold yet the set of elements that are *both* a snorf **and** a zooping\u2011grink can be empty.\n\n4. **The conclusion insists on existence**\n\nThe conclusion says **there is at least one** entity that is simultaneously a snorf and a zooping\u2011grink. That is a *particular* affirmative (the \u201cI\u201d form in categorical logic). Because the premises give no guarantee that either class has any member, the conclusion cannot be logically inferred\u2014they can all be empty or disjoint.\n\n5. **Logical Form / Syllogistic Mood**\n\nLet\u2019s express the form in conventional categorical moods:\n\n```\nNo S are M      (O)\nAll P are M     (A)\nConclusion: Some S are P (I)\n```\n\nThis pattern is one of the classic *invalid* moods (it doesn\u2019t appear in the list of valid moods).  \n\n---\n\n### Quick counterexample (a model)  \n\nAssign the following:\n\n| Domain | Snorf | ZoopingGrink | HasPlimbles |\n|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1 | False | False | False |\n| 2 | False | True  | True |\n| 3 | True  | False | False |\n\n*Premise\u202f1:* No snorfs have plimbles \u2192 holds (snorf 3 has no plimbles).  \n*Premise\u202f2:* All zooping grinks have plimbles \u2192 holds (zooping grink 2 has plimbles).  \n*Conclusion:* Some snorfs are zooping grinks \u2192 **fails** (no element satisfies both).\n\nThus the conclusions can be false while premises are true, proving invalidity.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do **not** entail that there is an entity belonging to both classes, the syllogism is logically **invalid**.

Check validity against the classical rules\n\nThe classical rule for Figure\u202f1 moods is that a form containing only an **A** major premise and an **I** minor premise is *valid* **if** the conclusion is **A** or **I**.  \nFor **A\u202fI\u202fI** (major **All M are P**, minor **Some S are M**, conclusion **Some S are P**) this is the valid categorical syllogism called **Barbara** for the A\u202fI\u202fA mood, but with a particular minor it becomes a permissible variation.\n\nIn contemporary diagrammatic/array analysis the form translates to:\n\n```\n    M  \u2192 P   (All M are P)\n    S  \u2192 M   (Some S are M)\n    -----------------------\n    Therefore S  \u2192 P   (Some S are P)\n```\n\nThis is a **tautological** inference: if a member of *S* is also a member of *M*, and every member of *M* is a member of *P*, then that member of *S* must belong to *P*. Therefore the syllogism is **logically valid**.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  What about the content?  \n\nThe *truth* of the conclusion depends on whether the premises are actually true in the real world:\n\n- **Premise\u202f1** (\u201cAll vehicles have wheels\u201d) is **false** because many vehicles (e.g., boats, airplanes, bicycles with no wheels, etc.) do **not** have wheels in the usual sense.  \n- **Premise\u202f2** (\u201cA boat is a vehicle\u201d) can be considered true in a general sense.  \n\nBecause the first premise is false, the conclusion (\u201ca boat has wheels\u201d) is, **in fact, false**, even though the reasoning is valid. This illustrates the difference between *logical validity* (does the form force the conclusion?) and *soundness* (are the premises true?).\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom line\n\n- **Formally**: The syllogism *All V are W \u00b7 A boat is V \u00b7 therefore a boat is W* is a valid categorical syllogism (an A\u202fI\u202fI in Figure\u202f1).  \n- **Epistemically**: Because one premise is factually false, the concrete conclusion is false.  \n- **Conclusion of this exercise**: The syllogism is **correct** in the sense of being *logically valid*, but it is *unsound* because the premises are not all true.",

Check for a valid categorical pattern\nThe pattern is **Barbara** (AAA\u20111 in the mnemonic: All V are W, All B are V, therefore All B are W). In our case, the second premise is a single instance rather than a universal statement, but that doesn\u2019t affect validity; the inference still works because the subject of the conclusion is the same individual named in the minor premise.\n\n#### 3. Apply the rule of inference (modus ponens)\nFrom \u201cAll V are W\u201d we know: **if anything is a V, then it must be a W**.\nFrom \u201cB is V\u201d we know: **B is a V**.\nBy modus ponens, we can infer: **B is a W**.\n\nThus **the syllogism is logically valid**: the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\n#### 4. Evaluate the truth of the premises\nLogical validity is concerned with structure, not factual truth. However, for completeness:\n\n- Premise\u202f1 (\u201cAll vehicles have wheels\u201d) is **false** in our actual world (boats, sailboats, paddleboats, etc.) do not have wheels.\n- Premise\u202f2 is **true** (boats are vehicles).\n\nBecause the first premise is false, the argument is **unsound** (a sound argument requires both validity and true premises). **Therefore, although the syllogism is valid, it is not sound**.\n\n---\n\n## Verdict\n\n- **Correctness of the syllogism (in terms of logical form):** **Correct / Valid**. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n- **Soundness (truth\u2011value of the premises):** **Incorrect / Unsound**, because Premise\u202f1 is factually false.\n\nSo, **the syllogism is logically correct (valid), but it is untenable in practice because the premises are not both true.**",

Translate the statements into symbolic logic\n\n| Original statement | Symbolic form (English) |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Premise\u202f1: \u201cAll things with an engine need oil.\u201d | \u2200x\u202f( Engine(x) \u2192 Oil(x) ) |\n| Premise\u202f2: \u201cCars need oil.\u201d | \u2200x\u202f( Car(x) \u2192 Oil(x) ) |\n| Conclusion: \u201cTherefore, cars have engines.\u201d | \u2200x\u202f( Car(x) \u2192 Engine(x) ) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Examine the logical relationship\n\n- Premise\u202f1 gives us a **universal conditional**:  \n  *If* something has an engine, *then* it needs oil.\n\n- Premise\u202f2 gives us another universal conditional:  \n  *If* something is a car, *then* it needs oil.\n\nNotice that **both premises supply the consequent \u201cneeds oil\u201d**.  \nWhat we want to conclude is the **reverse implication** (converse) of Premise\u202f1:  \n**If** something needs oil *then* it must have an engine.\n\nThat logical step is not supported by the information we have. The only conclusion we can safely draw from the premises is that all cars are here\u2011situated in the set of \u201cthings that need oil\u201d. The rule that \u201csomething needs oil \u2192 it has an engine\u201d is not given, nor does it follow from what we know.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Identify the type of fallacy\n\nThe pattern  \n\n> All A are B.  \n> All C are B.  \n> **Therefore, all C are A.**\n\nis a classic example of an **affirming the consequent** fallacy (or more precisely, a *converse error*). The conclusion \u201cC \u2192 A\u201d is the converse of the valid inference \u201cA \u2192 B\u201d that we actually have. Such a converse inference is generally false unless an additional condition (e.g., \u201cif and only if\u201d) is present.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Concrete counter\u2011example\n\nTo be absolutely clear, let's give a real\u2011world counter\u2011example that satisfies the premises but not the conclusion:\n\n| Item | Has engine? | Needs oil? (according to premises) |\n|------|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| Car 1 (a gasoline car) | Yes | Yes (must, by Premise\u202f1) |\n| Car 2 (an electric car) | **No** | **Yes** (Premise\u202f2 says all cars need oil, but electric cars normally do **not** *need gasoline oil*; however, the premises can be interpreted loosely or a car may need oil in a different part \u2013 the premises allow the possibility) |\n\nIn this example, Car\u202f2 is a car (so it \u201cneeds oil\u201d per Premise\u202f2), but it does **not** have an engine (as we interpret \u201cengine\u201d to mean a gasoline\u2011fueled internal combustion engine). The premises hold, yet the conclusion is false.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary\n\nBecause the premises only give us:\n\n1. **Engine \u2192 Oil**  \n2. **Car \u2192 Oil**\n\nwe cannot deduce **Car \u2192 Engine**. The argument commits a logical fallacy, so the syllogism is **incorrect**.",

What the premises actually give us\n\nFrom Premise\u202f1 we know the *direction* \u201cengine\u202f\u2192\u202foil.\u201d  \nFrom Premise\u202f2 we know \u201ccar\u202f\u2192\u202foil.\u201d  \nThus we have:\n\n- If something **has an engine**, it **needs oil**.  \n- If something **is a car**, it **needs oil**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. The fallacy \u2013 \u201caffirming the consequent\u201d\n\nThe conclusion attempts to invert the relationship:\n\n> From \u201cIf X has an engine, then X needs oil\u201d  \n> and \u201c\ud83d\ude97 needs oil\u201d  \n> conclude \u201c\ud83d\ude97 has an engine.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly the logical fallacy known as **affirming the consequent** (or **converse error**).  \nIn formal logic:\n\n- Premise\u202f1 gives: **E \u2192 O** (Engine \u21d2 Oil).\n- Premise\u202f2 gives: **C \u2192 O** (Car \u21d2 Oil).\n\nBut we cannot infer the converse **C \u2192 E** (Car \u21d2 Engine) without evidence that oil is *exclusively* a characteristic of engines.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Counter\u2011example (illustrating the invalidity)\n\nConsider a **bicycle**:\n\n- A bicycle **does not** have an engine (Engine(bike) is false).\n- Yet a bicycle **does** need oil for its chain (NeedsOil(bike) is true).\n\nThus we have something that **needs oil but has no engine**. The premises would still be true, but the conclusion \u201cCars have engines\u201d would be false. Since we can construct a world where the premises are true and the conclusion false, the argument is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Summary\n\nThe logical structure is:\n\n```\nPremise\u202f1:  E \u2192 O\nPremise\u202f2:  C \u2192 O\nConclusion: C \u2192 E   \u2190 invalid\n```\n\nBecause the premises only set up a one\u2011way implication (engine \u2192 oil) and the conclusion requires the opposite implication (oil \u2192 engine, which is not given), the syllogism **fails** and must be classified as **incorrect**.\n\n---",

Why the argument is \u201cinvalid\u201d  \n\nIn propositional/predicate logic, an argument is **valid** if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.  \nHere the conclusion **\u2203(Car \u2192 HasEngine)** does **not** logically follow from the premises; we can find interpretations (as above) where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false.

Conclusion\n\nBecause the categorical structure does **not** preserve truth, and the inference commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent / undistributed middle, the syllogism is **incorrect** (invalid).

What the premises actually state\n\n1. **Premise 1** tells us that *having a glibbet is a sufficient condition for needing framble*:  \n   If G(x), then F(x).\n\n2. **Premise 2** tells us *that snazzles do need framble*:  \n   F(s).\n\n---\n\n## 3. The logical relationship (or lack thereof)\n\n- From \\(G(x) \\rightarrow F(x)\\) we can **infer** \\(G(s) \\rightarrow F(s)\\) (by universal instantiation).  \n- But we **cannot** reverse the implication: \\(F(s)\\) does **not** imply \\(G(s)\\).  \n\nIn other words, \u201cneeds framble\u201d is an effect of \u201chas a glibbet\u201d, not a cause. Knowing that the effect is present does not guarantee that the cause is present.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recognizing the fallacy\n\nThe inference pattern is\n\n\\[\n\\text{If } A \\text{ then } B \\quad\\text{and}\\quad B \\;\\;\\;\\; \\leadsto\\;\\;\\; A\n\\]\n\nThis is the classic **affirming the consequent** fallacy (also known as *converse error* or *fallacy of the converse*). It is formally invalid: the premises are true while the conclusion can be false.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Counter\u2011example that shows invalidity\n\nSuppose there exists an entity \\(x\\) that **needs framble** but **does not** have a glibbet. For concreteness:\n\n- Let **Targh** be an object that needs framble (F(Targh) is true).\n- Targh does **not** have a glibbet (G(Targh) is false).\n\nThis satisfies Premise\u202f1: \u201cIf G(x) then F(x)\u201d is vacuously true for Targh because the antecedent is false. Premise\u202f2 is satisfied for snazzles. Yet the conclusion \u201csnazzles have glibbets\u201d is independent of what Targh does. The existence of such an object shows that the conclusion does **not** logically follow from the premises.\n\nAlternatively, we can construct a universe in which *all* entities that need framble happen to have glibbets *except* for snazzles. In that universe:\n\n- Premise\u202f1: \u201cAll things with a glibbet need framble\u201d is true (because every glibbet\u2011owner does need framble).\n- Premise\u202f2: \u201cSnazzles need framble\u201d is true.\n- Conclusion: \u201cSnazzles have glibbets\u201d is false.\n\nThus, the syllogism can be satisfied while the conclusion fails; the inference is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Formal proof that the inference is invalid\n\nIn classical propositional logic, the argument form is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A \\rightarrow B, \\; B}{\\therefore \\; A}\n\\]\n\nOne can show that this is not a valid inference by looking at truth\u2011tables:\n\n| A | B | A\u2192B | Premises satisfied? | Conclusion (A) |\n|---|---|-----|----------------------|----------------|\n| T | T | T   | Yes                  | T            |\n| T | F | F   | No                   | T            |\n| F | T | T   | Yes (since A\u2192B is true) | F          |\n| F | F | T   | Yes                  | F            |\n\nOnly in rows 1 and 3 are *both* premises true; in row\u202f3 the conclusion is false. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Final verdict\n\nBecause the syllogism embodies the *affirming the consequent* fallacy, it is **incorrect**. The premises do not support the conclusion: even though snazzles need framble, we cannot deduce that they must have glibbets. The correct conclusion might be *\u201cIf snazzles have glibbets, then they need framble,\u201d* which is already given by Premise\u202f1, but we cannot reverse it.",

Check categorical syllogism form\n\nThe structure is:\n\n1. **All G are F**  \n2. **All S are F**  \n3. **\u2234 All S are G**\n\nThis is the textbook *undistributed\u2011middle* fallacy:\n\n- **A\u2011type premises**: \u201cAll M are P\u201d and \u201cAll S are P\u201d.\n- **Conclusion**: \u201cAll S are M\u201d.\n\nThe middle term **P** (\u201cneeds framble\u201d) is **not distributed** in either premise. Therefore it is not possible to transfer its property back to the other term.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Counter\u2011example\n\nLet\u2019s instantiate the terms with concrete sets:\n\n* **G** = \u201cdogs\u201d (things with a glibbet)  \n* **F** = \u201canimals\u201d (things that need framble)  \n* **S** = \u201ccats\u201d (snazzles)\n\nPremises:\n1. All dogs are animals (true).  \n2. All cats are animals (true).\n\nConclusion:\n- All cats are dogs? (false)\n\nSince the premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBecause the middle term (\u201cneeds framble\u201d) is undistibuted and no logical inference can be made from the two premises to the conclusion, the syllogism is **incorrect** (logically invalid). The correct way would be to use the *Illicit major* form: *All G are F* & *All S are G* \u2192 *All S are F* (which is valid), but that doesn\u2019t match the premises given.

When we list the standard 19 (or 20) valid forms, none of them have the form:\n\n```\nA \u2013 A \u2013 A\n```\n\nwith the middle term absent from distribution. Hence it cannot be one of the classical valid figures (Barbara, Celarent, Darii, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Identify the fallacy\n\nThe argument commits the **fallacy of affirming the consequent** (or, in categorical terms, the *undistributed middle* fallacy):\n\n- From \u201cAll G are F\u201d and \u201cAll S are F\u201d we cannot infer that \u201cAll S are G.\u201d  \n- The conclusion re\u2011assigns a property (having a glibbet) to a group solely on the basis that the group shares a *different* property (needing framble).\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Summary\n\n- **Premise 1** distributes *G* (the subject) but not *F* (the predicate).  \n- **Premise 2** distributes *S* (the subject) but not *F*.  \n- The middle term *F* is undistributed in both premises.  \n- The conclusion tries to distribute *G* incorrectly.  \n\nThese structural mismatches mean the syllogism fails the *distribution requirement*, and consequently **it is invalid**.\n\n**Therefore, the conclusion \u201csnazzles have glibbets\u201d does not logically follow from the two premises.**",

The middle term *framble* merely tells us that both groups (glibbet\u2011possessing things and snazzles) are inside a larger collection (the framble\u2011needing set).

Knowing that a snazzle is framble does *not* give any information about whether a snazzle is a glibbet. In propositional terms:\n\n- Premise 1 says \\(G \\implies F\\).\n- Premise 2 says \\(S \\implies F\\).\n- The conclusion would require \\(S \\implies G\\).\n\nBut the truth of \\(G \\implies F\\) and \\(S \\implies F\\) tells us nothing about the relationship between \\(S\\) and \\(G\\). The only thing we can deduce is that:\n\n\\[\nS \\implies F \\quad\\text{and}\\quad G \\implies F \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\text{both }S\\text{ and }G\\text{ belong to the set \u201cneeds framble\u201d.}\n\\]\n\nIt does **not** permit us to conclude that any element of the set \u201csnazzles\u201d belongs to the set \u201cglibbet\u201d.

Thus the conclusion fails even though both premises are true. Replace \u201ccats\u201d by \u201cglibbet\u201d, \u201canimals\u201d by \u201cframble\u201d, and \u201cbicycles\u201d by \u201csnazzles\u201d and the same logical structure holds.\n\n---\n\n### Classical categorical logic check\n\nIn categorical logic, a valid syllogism must meet distribution and quantity requirements. The proposed syllogism would be in the form:\n\n- Major premise (A type): All G are F.\n- Minor premise (A type): All S are F.\n- Conclusion (A type): All S are G.\n\nThis is an **A,A,A** form, but it fails even the distribution rule because the middle term **F** is undistributed in the conclusion, yet it was not distributed in the premises. Therefore it is not a valid categorical syllogism.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **The syllogism is logically invalid.**  \n- The inference commits the converse error: from \u201cAll G \u2192 F\u201d and \u201cAll S \u2192 F\u201d one cannot deduce \u201cAll S \u2192 G\u201d.  \n- A counter\u2011example confirms that the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nHence the syllogism is **incorrect**.",

The only relation we know is:\n\n> **If** an object has a glibbet **then** it needs framble.  \n> **But** we never have the *converse*: \u201cIf an object needs framble **then** it has a glibbet.\u201d\n\n### Why it\u2019s a fallacy\n\nIt is essentially a **fallacy of affirming the consequent** (or, more broadly, the fallacy of the converse). \n\n```\n       G(x)  \u2192  N(x)      (premise 2)\n       S(x)  \u2192  N(x)      (premise 1)\n                                      We want:\n       S(x)  \u2192  G(x)      (conclusion)\n```\n\nFrom the first two arrows we cannot infer the third arrow. The fact that snazzles need framble only tells us that they are \u201cframble\u2011needing\u201d objects; it tells us nothing about whether they *do* have glibbets. There could be many other kinds of objects that need framble but do not have glibbets.\n\n---\n\n## Counterexample illustration\n\nSuppose you have two objects:\n\n| Object | Has glibbet? | Needs framble? |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| Snazzle A | **No** | **Yes** |\n| Gibbette B | **Yes** | **Yes** |\n\nBoth entries satisfy premise 2 (every thing with a glibbet needs framble).

They do **not** assert that the two causes are the *same* or that one implies the other.\n* **Formal fallacy of Undistributed Middle**: In categorical logic, the middle term (*needs framble* here) is not distributed in either premise.

Check the syllogistic form  \nThe structure is:\n\n```\nAll M are P\nAll S are M\n\u2234 All S are P\n```\n\nThis matches the classic *Barbara* mood in traditional logic (AAA\u20112).  \n*All* (universal) statements for both premises yield an *universal* conclusion, and the middle term occurs twice (affirming the middle term), which is the necessary sustainment rule.  \nTherefore, **the form is logically valid**.\n\n### 4. Consider possible objections  \n- **Meaning of \u201cCigarettes are smoked\u201d**  \n  In everyday language, a cigarette is an object that people typically smoke.  So the statement that \u201ccigarettes are smoked\u201d can be taken as true: any object that is subject to smoking is a *smoked thing*.  \n- **Interpretation of \u201cbad for your health\u201d**  \n  The premise claims a *necessary* relation: if something is smoked, it is bad for your health.  Technically, that means *every* occurrence of smoking a cigarette makes it \u201cbad\u201d (in the sense of harming health).  In ordinary use, the intended meaning is \u201cif you smoke a cigarette, you risk health harm.\u201d  For the logical structure, this is sufficient.\n\n### 5. Soundness (truth of premises) vs. validity (form)  \n- **Validity**: The syllogism is valid; the format guarantees the conclusion follows from the premises.  \n- **Soundness**: The premises might be contestable in real life (e.g., \u201call smoked things are bad for your health\u201d is an over\u2011generalization that ignores dose, personal health, etc.).  Soundness depends on empirical truth, which is not part of the logical test.  \nThus the syllogism is **correct in the strict sense of logical validity**.\n\n---\n\n## Final answer\n\n**The syllogism is correct (logically valid).**  While the premises themselves might be misleading or factually debatable, the categorical form guarantees that the stated conclusion follows validly from the premises.",

Such a structure is *valid*: the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. |\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Validity vs. Soundness**  \n   * The syllogism is *valid* because the logical form guarantees the conclusion if the premises are true.  \n   * Soundness would also require that Premise\u202f1 (\u201cAll\u2011smoked\u2011things are bad\u201d) and Premise\u202f2 (\u201cCigarettes are smoked\u201d) are factually true. The question asks about correctness in the logical sense, so soundness is not required for the answer.\n\n2. **Common Interpretation Issues**  \n   \u2022 \u201cCigarettes are smoked\u201d might at first glance read as \u201cCigarettes are smoked by people.\u201d In the categorical sense, it nonetheless assigns cigarettes to the set of things that are smoked, which is enough for the syllogistic logic to work.  \n   \u2022 The universal statement \u201cAll things that are smoked are bad for your health\u201d is *strong*, but logical analysis only cares about the structure, not the truth value of that claim.\n\n3. **The Syllogistic Mood**  \n   \u2022 Premise\u202f1: **All S are P** (A sentence).  \n   \u2022 Premise\u202f2: **All X are S** (A sentence).  \n   \u2022 Conclusion: **All X are P** (A sentence).  \n   This is the standard *AAA* mode (Barbara).

Check the figure and mood\n\n- **Mood**: AAA (All\u202fS\u202fare\u202fP; All\u202fM\u202fare\u202fS; \u2234 All\u202fM\u202fare\u202fP).\n- **Figure**: 2nd figure? Let\u2019s place the terms:\n\n```\nPremise 1:   All S are P\nPremise 2:   All M are S\nConclusion:  All M are P\n```\n\nThe middle term (**M**) is the subject in the second premise and the predicate in the conclusion, a valid configuration.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Validate the logical form\n\nIn categorical logic, the syllogistic rule *Barbara* (AAA\u20111) states:\n\n> If **All\u202fM\u202fare\u202fS** and **All\u202fS\u202fare\u202fP**, then **All\u202fM\u202fare\u202fP**.\n\nOur syllogism matches *Barbara* exactly. Therefore, the form is **valid** \u2013 it logically guarantees the truth of the conclusion whenever the premises are true.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Consider possible objections\n\n- **Semantic oddity**: Saying \u201cCigarettes are smoked\u201d is a slightly unconventional way to express \u201cCigarettes belong to the class of smoked things.\u201d  But it's a perfectly acceptable categorical statement: *All\u202fcigarettes are smoked things*.\n- **Truth\u2011value of premises**: If either premise is factually false (e.g., if \u201cAll smoked things are bad for your health\u201d is too strong), then the conclusion might be false.  Logical validity does **not** assure truth; it only assures that if the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true.\n- **Scope**: \u201cThings that are smoked\u201d covers a broad class (tobacco, metal, etc.), and not every smoked thing may be harmful\u2014but that is outside the scope of pure formal validity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Final verdict\n\n**The syllogism is structurally correct (valid).**\n\n- The categorical form is *AAA* in the appropriate figure, which is valid.\n- There is no logical fallacy present in the structure itself.\n\nWhether the conclusion is empirically true depends on the factual accuracy of the premises, but from a purely logical standpoint, the syllogism is correct.",

For instance, \u201cAll things that are smoked are bad for your health\u201d isn\u2019t universally true\u2014there are collectibles or some experimental substances that are smoked without that health effect, and even human bodies can tolerate smoke differently. Thus the syllogism would be *unsound* if applied to factual claims.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **Is the syllogism structurally correct?**  \n  **Yes** \u2013 it follows a valid categorical form.\n\n- **Is it factually trustworthy?**  \n  Not necessarily \u2013 it depends on whether the premises are actually true. The argument is *valid* but *unsound* if the premises fail.\n\nSo, the syllogism itself is correct in terms of logical structure; its real\u2011world reliability rests on the truth of its premises.",

Translate the propositions into categorical form\n\n| Statement | Symbolic form | Explanation |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| **Premise\u202f1:** *Cigarettes are smoked.* | \u2200x (\u202fCigarette(x) \u2192 Smoked(x)\u202f) | \u201cAll cigarettes fall into the class of \u2018things that are smoked.\u2019\u201d |\n| **Premise\u202f2:** *All things that are smoked are bad for your health.* | \u2200x (\u202fSmoked(x) \u2192 BadForHealth(x)\u202f) | A universal affirmative (All S are B). |\n| **Conclusion:** *Cigarettes are bad for your health.* | \u2200x (\u202fCigarette(x) \u2192 BadForHealth(x)\u202f) | \u201cAll cigarettes are bad for your health.\u201d |\n\nWe can rename the predicates for a classic syllogistic skeleton:\n\n* **C \u2013 cigarettes**  \n* **S \u2013 things that are smoked**  \n* **B \u2013 things that are bad for your health**\n\nSo the premises read:\n\n1. **All C are S**.  \n2. **All S are B**.\n\nConclusion:\n\n* **All C are B**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine the syllogistic figure and mood\n\n| Feature | Value |\n|---------|-------|\n| **Figure** | 1 (the middle term, *S*, is the predicate in both premises) |\n| **Mood** | Barbara (AAA \u2013 all three propositions are universal affirmatives) |\n\n**Barbara** is a perfectly valid syllogistic mood. It is one of the six *valid* moods that have always been recognized in Aristotelian logic.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Verify the correctness of the inference\n\nWith **All C are S** and **All S are B**, we can conclude **All C are B** by the transitive property of universal affirmation. In modern propositional terms:\n\n```\n\u2200x (C(x) \u2192 S(x))   -- premise 1\n\u2200x (S(x) \u2192 B(x))   -- premise 2\n\u2234  \u2200x (C(x) \u2192 B(x))   -- conclusion\n```\n\nThis follows directly by modus ponens (in predicate logic) or by the standard syllogistic rule:\n\n> **If all members of C are members of S, and all members of S are members of B, then all members of C are members of B.**\n\nHence the logical form is *sound* if the premises are factually correct. The *validity* (correctness of form) is independent of the truth of the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Caveats (not about logical form)\n\nWhile the form is correct, the argument\u2019s *truth* depends on the premises:\n\n* **Premise\u202f1**: In everyday life most cigarettes are indeed smoked, but technically a \u201ccigarette\u201d is a product that can exist whether it is smoked or not. If the premise is taken as a universal statement (\u201cAll C are S\u201d), it is *not* strictly accurate because there can be unburnt, unused cigarettes. Still, for the purpose of the given logical exercise it is treated as a categorical truth.\n\n* **Premise\u202f2**: The claim that *all* smoked things are bad for your health is an over\u2011generalization. For instance, smoking *some* kind of herbal or herbal\u2011tobacco product might not be harmful, or there may be contexts in which \u201csmoking\u201d is safe. The deduction would still be structurally valid even if the premises were false.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bottom line\n\n**The syllogism is correct in form.**  \nIt utilizes the universally valid Barbara mood in figure\u202f1. The conclusion follows logically from the two premises, making it a valid syllogism. Whether the argument is *sound* (i.e., has true premises) is a separate matter.",

This contradicts step\u202f1, where \\(S(a)\\) is true.  \n   Therefore **a** cannot be a trizzle.\n\n6. Consequently, the same object **a** satisfies \\(B(a)\\) and \\(\\neg T(a)\\).  \n   Hence there exists an object that is a bramble **and** not a trizzle.\n\n7. That is exactly the statement of **Conclusion\u202f3**:  \n   \\(\\exists x \\, (B(x) \\land \\neg T(x))\\).\n\nThus Premises\u202f1 and\u202f2 imply Premise\u202f3 \u2013 the syllogism is **valid**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Formal Deduction (Predicate\u2011logic style)\n\nLet the following abbreviations be used:\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|--------|--------|\n| **\\(Sk(x)\\)** | *x* is a skyscraper |\n| **\\(Bld(x)\\)** | *x* is a building |\n| **\\(Wood(x)\\)** | *x* is a wooden thing |\n\nPremise\u202f1: \\(\\forall x (Sk(x) \\rightarrow \\neg Wood(x))\\)  \nPremise\u202f2: \\(\\exists x (Bld(x) \\land Wood(x))\\)\n\nConclusion (to prove): \\(\\exists x (Bld(x) \\land \\neg Sk(x))\\)\n\n**Proof**  \n\n1. From Premise\u202f2, let \\(a\\) be an object such that \\(Bld(a) \\land Wood(a)\\).  \n2. Premise\u202f1 gives \\(\\forall x (Sk(x) \\rightarrow \\neg Wood(x))\\); by contraposition we may equivalently say \\(\\forall x (Wood(x) \\rightarrow \\neg Sk(x))\\).  \n3. Apply 2 to the particular instance \\(a\\): Since \\(Wood(a)\\), therefore \\(\\neg Sk(a)\\).  \n4. Thus we have \\(Bld(a) \\land \\neg Sk(a)\\).  \n5. By existential introduction, \\(\\exists x (Bld(x) \\land \\neg Sk(x))\\).\n\nHence the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Intuitive Reasoning\n\n- **Premise\u202f1** says: *No place that is a skyscraper carries wood.*  \n- **Premise\u202f2** says: *There is at least one building that does carry wood.*  \n- Because wood\u2011carrying buildings cannot be skyscrapers (by Premise\u202f1), that particular building from Premise\u202f2 is a building that is **not** a skyscraper.  \n- Therefore, *some* buildings are not skyscrapers.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Caveats\n\n| Issue | Explanation |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Implicit knowledge needed?** | The conclusion doesn\u2019t actually depend on whether skyscrapers are in the broader class of buildings; the existence of any wooden building guarantees that such a building is not a skyscraper. |\n| **Modern predicate\u2011logic vs. Aristotelian** | In standard modern predicate logic, \u201cSome\u202fP\u202fare\u202fM\u201d is taken to carry existential import (there is at least one such object). Under that assumption the argument is valid as shown. If one uses a system that *does not* assume existential import for \u201cSome\u202fP\u202fare\u202fM,\u201d the conclusion is still valid because the two premises jointly ensure existence of a wooden building. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Bottom Line\n\nThe argument can be written in a valid categorical mood and, by either standard categorical logic or standard predicate logic, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.  \n**Therefore, the syllogism is correct (valid).**",

Logical inference  \n\nFrom Premise\u202f1 we have the universal negative proposition \u201cNo \\(P\\) are \\(G\\)\u201d.  \nIn Aristotelian logic, this is an **E\u2011proposition** (both terms distributed).  \nIt is logically equivalent to the conditional\n\\( G(x) \\rightarrow \\neg P(x) \\); i.e.  \nevery gribbled thing is **not** a plonkie.\n\nPremise\u202f2 says there exists an \\(x\\) such that \\(T(x)\\) and \\(G(x)\\).  \nApplying the derived implication from Premise\u202f1 to that same \\(x\\) we get\n\\( \\neg P(x) \\).\n\nThus for that particular \\(x\\) we have:\n\\( T(x) \\land \\neg P(x) \\),\n\nwhich is precisely the content of the conclusion:\n\\( \\exists x\\, (T(x)\\land \\neg P(x)) \\).\n\nSo the conclusion is logically entailed by the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Checking the categorical mood (traditional validity test)\n\n* **Major term**: \\(P\\) (plonkies) \u2013 appears in Premise\u202f1 and in the conclusion.  \n  It is **distributed** in Premise\u202f1 (E\u2011proposition).  \n  The rule \u201c*major term must be distributed in a premise*\u201d is satisfied.\n\n* **Minor term**: \\(T\\) (thwacks) \u2013 appears in Premise\u202f2 and in the conclusion.  \n  It is **distributed** in the conclusion (the subject in an O\u2011proposition is distributed).  \n  The rule \u201c*minor term must be distributed at least once (in premise or conclusion)*\u201d is satisfied.\n\n* **Middle term**: \\(G\\) (gribbled things) \u2013 distributed in Premise\u202f1.  \n  The rule \u201c*middle term must be distributed in at least one premise*\u201d holds.\n\nWe therefore have the classic valid mood: **E\u202fI\u202fO** (major E, minor I, conclusion O),\nwhich is among the nine standard valid categorical forms.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Intuitive picture  \n\n- The first premise tells us that **plonkies and gribbled things are disjoint**.  \n- The second premise guarantees that **there is at least one entity that is both a thwack and a gribbled thing**.  \n- Because *no* plonkies can be gribbled, that particular thwack **cannot be a plonkie**.  \n- Hence \u201cthere is a thwack that is not a plonkie\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Better: P2 gives us directly that *no* cigarette is inexpensive. The contrapositive doesn\u2019t help because we know \\(a\\) is inexpensive, not that \\(a\\) is a cigarette. Instead we use the following observation:\n\n   Since \\(C(y)\\) implies \\(\\neg I(y)\\), it follows that any object that *is* inexpensive *cannot* be a cigarette. Formally, from:\n   \\[\n   \\forall y \\bigl(C(y) \\rightarrow \\neg I(y)\\bigr)\n   \\]\n   we can infer by contrapositive:\n   \\[\n   \\forall y \\bigl(I(y) \\rightarrow \\neg C(y)\\bigr)\n   \\]\n   (The contrapositive of \u201cif \\(C\\) then not \\(I\\)\u201d is \u201cif \\(I\\) then not \\(C\\)\u201d.)  \n\n   Therefore, because \\(I(a)\\) is true, we conclude \\(\\neg C(a)\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**  \n   We have found an object \\(a\\) such that:\n   - \\(A(a)\\) (by P1),\n   - \\(\\neg C(a)\\) (from step\u202f2).  \n\n   Hence, \\(\\exists z \\bigl(A(z) \\land \\neg C(z)\\bigr)\\) is true. This is exactly the conclusion of the syllogism.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Categorical\u2011logic check (Venn diagram)\n\nIf we draw Venn diagrams for the three sets:\n\n- **Addictive things** (A)\n- **Cigarettes** (C)\n- **Inexpensive** (I)\n\nPremise\u202f1 says that the *A\u2229I* region is non\u2011empty.  \nPremise\u202f2 says that the *C\u2229I* region is empty.\n\nBecause the *A\u2229I* region exists, at least one element lies in A but outside C (since the intersection with C is empty). Thus the *A\u2216C* region is non\u2011empty, which is precisely the conclusion \u201cSome addictive things are not cigarettes.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nSince both the formal first\u2011order derivation and the categorical Venn\u2011diagram reasoning lead us inevitably to the conclusion, **the syllogism is logically valid**.

Does the conclusion follow?  \n\n1. From Premise\u202f2 we know that **there is at least one** element *d* such that  \n   *H(d)*\u202f\u2227\u202f*V(d)*.  \n2. Premise\u202f1 tells us that **no** police dog can be vicious:  \n   \u2200x (\u202fP(x)\u202f\u2192\u202f\u00acV(x)\u202f).  \n   In particular \u2013 and here this is key \u2013 if *d* were a police dog (*P(d)*) it would **not** be vicious, contradicting the fact that *V(d)* is true.  \n3. Therefore *P(d)* is false; i.e. \u00ac*P(d)*.  \n4. Combining (2) and (3) gives  \n   *H(d)*\u202f\u2227\u202f\u00ac*P(d)*, which is precisely the existential statement of the conclusion.\n\nThus, whenever both premises hold, the conclusion must also hold. Hence the inference is logically **valid**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why it\u2019s not a *traditional* categorical syllogism?  \n\nIn classical categorical logic (the \u201cAristotelian\u201d form) a syllogism is characterized by:\n\n1. **Three terms** \u2013 major, minor, and middle.\n2. **The middle term must appear as the subject of at least one premise.**\n\nIn this argument the middle term (*V* = \u201cvicious\u201d) appears as the **predicate** in *both* premises \u2013 it is never a subject.  \nThis arrangement corresponds to *Figure\u202f4*, a figure that seldom yields valid moods in the familiar *AAA\u20111*, *EAE\u20111*, etc. forms. As a result, the argument does **not** qualify as a *standard* categorical syllogism in the sense of the classical syllogistic school.\n\nHowever, once we step out of that strict schematic framework and look at the argument in first\u2011order logic (or just perform the reasoning manually, as above), the conclusion remains unconditionally true. So the argument is logically valid even if it is not one of the canonical forms of Aristotelian syllogisms.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Bottom\u2011line\n\n- **In formal first\u2011order logic**: \u2714\u202f**Valid**  \n- **In the strict classical syllogistic taxonomy**: \u274c\u202f*Not a recognized syllogism*  \n\nBecause the question asks whether the syllogism as presented is *correct* or *incorrect*, and the premises indeed force the conclusion, the safe answer is **correct (valid)**.",

In other words:\n\n```\n\u2200y ( y \u2208 PoliceDogs  \u2192  y \u2209 Vicious )\n```\n\nBecause *x* is vicious, the implication above forces *x* **not** to be a police dog:\n\n```\nx \u2208 Vicious   \u2192   x \u2209 PoliceDogs\n```\n\nCombining the two facts we have:\n\n```\nx \u2208 HighlyTrained  \u2227  x \u2209 PoliceDogs\n```\n\nwhich is **exactly** the statement \u201csome highly trained dogs are not police dogs.\u201d Hence the conclusion is logically forced by the premises.\n\n---\n\n### In categorical\u2011syllogistic terms\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1**: E\u202fsentence (\u201cNo police dogs are vicious\u201d) \u2013 universal negative.  \n2. **Premise\u202f2**: I\u202fsentence (\u201cSome highly trained dogs are vicious\u201d) \u2013 particular affirmative.  \n3. **Conclusion**: O\u202fsentence (\u201cSome highly trained dogs are not police dogs\u201d) \u2013 particular negative.\n\nThe pattern **E\u2011I \u21d2 O** is a valid categorical syllogism (Figure\u202f3 in Aristotelian terms).  \n\nThe crucial element is the *existential import* of the I premise, which guarantees that a highly trained vicious dog actually exists. Once that existence is confirmed, the disjointness asserted by the E premise immediately excludes that dog from the police\u2011dog class. Thus the existence of a non\u2011police highly trained dog is guaranteed.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Premise 1** + **Premise 2** logically force the conclusion.  \n- No logical fallacies or hidden assumptions appear.  \n\nTherefore, the syllogism you presented is **correct (valid)**.",

Is the mood \\(EIO\\) valid in Figure\u202f4?  \n\nThe classic syllogistic list of valid moods for Figure\u202f4 contains:\n\n| Mood | Valid? |\n|------|--------|\n| **EIO** | **Yes** |\n| AIO | Yes |\n| EAI | No |\n| EII | No |\n| ... | ... |\n\nSo the combination \\(EIO\\) **is** a valid syllogistic mood in Figure\u202f4.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Semantic argument (diagrammatic proof)\n\n1. Premise\u202f1: *No liquors are sweet things* \u2013 any member of the class \u201csweet things\u201d is **not** a member of the class \u201cliquors\u201d.\n2. Premise\u202f2: *Some drinks are sweet things* \u2013 there exists at least one entity that is both a drink **and** a sweet thing.\n3. From (1), that entity cannot belong to the class \u201cliquors\u201d.\n4. Therefore, there exists a drink that is **not** a liquor \u2192 *Some drinks are not liquors*.\n\nThis reasoning follows the classic *distributive\u2013class*-pattern:\n\n- The middle term (*sweet things*) is distributed in the first premise (No = universal negative).  \n- The subject of the conclusion (*drinks*) is distributed in the second premise (Some = particular affirmative).  \n- The conclusion asserts a distribution of the subjects of one premise that is guaranteed by the combination of premises.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Counter\u2011example test\n\nTo disprove the syllogism one would need a situation where:\n\n- Premise\u202f1 holds,  \n- Premise\u202f2 holds,  \n- but the conclusion is false (i.e., *no* drink is not a liquor, or equivalently *all* drinks are liquors).\n\nCheck:\n\n- If *all* drinks are liquors, then by Premise\u202f1 **no** drink can be sweet (because no liquors are sweet).  \n- That would contradict Premise\u202f2 (\u201csome drinks are sweet\u201d).  \n\nThus such a counter\u2011example cannot exist; the conclusion must follow.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Conclusion\n\nThe premises logically entail the conclusion; the syllogism is **valid** (correct).",

Put the Premises into Form\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1:** \u201cNo liquors are sweet things.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is a universal negative (E\u2011form): **No P are M**  \n   \u2013 In canonical form: **E** (No P are M)\n\n2. **Premise\u202f2:** \u201cSome drinks are sweet things.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is a particular affirmative (I\u2011form): **Some S are M**  \n   \u2013 In canonical form: **I** (Some S are M)\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \u201cSome drinks are not liquors.\u201d  \n   \u2013 This is a particular negative (O\u2011form): **Some S are not P**  \n   \u2013 In canonical form: **O** (Some S are not P)\n\nSo the mood of the argument is **EIO** (E, I, O).\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Identify the Figure\n\nThe *figure* depends on the position of the middle term **M (sweet things)** in the premises:\n\n| Premise | Position of M |\n|---------|---------------|\n| 1st (major) | predicate of major premise (but here it is the subject) |\n| 2nd (minor) | predicate |\n\nActually, **M appears as the predicate in both premises**.  \nThat would normally correspond to **Figure\u202f2**.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Check the Rules of Validity\n\nA categorical syllogism is valid only if it satisfies the **five key rules** (the \u201cDoctrines of Validity\u201d):\n\n1. **All terms used in the conclusion must appear in the premises.** \u2717  \n   - **Yes, all terms appear together in the premises.** (OK)\n\n2. **The middle term must appear in both premises.** \u2717  \n   - **Yes, it does (sweet things).** (OK)\n\n3. **Each term must appear at least once.** \u2717  \n   - **All appear.** (OK)\n\n4. **The major term must be the predicate of the major premise.**  \n   - **Here, the major premise is presumed to be the one containing the major term.**  \n   - **Premise\u202f1 (\u201cNo liquors are sweet things\u201d)** has **liquors (P)** as the *subject*, not the predicate.  \n   - Therefore **Premise\u202f1 cannot be the major premise** according to the strict rules of the system.  \n   - Since the major premise is missing, **the syllogism violates the third rule** (the major term must be in the predicate position of a premise).  \n\n5. **(Additional rules on existence, distribution, etc.)**  \n   - Not applicable because the syllogism already fails earlier.\n\nBecause the **major premise is malformed**\u2014the major term **liquors** appears in the *subject* position instead of the *predicate*\u2014the argument fails the fourth rule of validity.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Can We Rearrange the Premises?\n\nIf you rearrange the syllogism by writing Premise\u202f1 as **\u201cNo sweet things are liquors.\u201d** (i.e., \u201cNo M are P\u201d \u2261 \u201cNo P are M\u201d), the syllogism becomes a canonical **EIO** in Figure\u202f2, which is a **valid** mood.  \n\nHowever, the *given* syllogism does not present the premise in that canonical form, so under the standard formal rules it is considered **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Summary\n\n- **Intuitively** the conclusion (\u201cSome drinks are not liquors\u201d) follows from the premises, but\n- **Formally** in categorical syllogistic logic the structure violates the requirement that the major term must appear as the predicate of the major premise.\n\n**Therefore, the syllogism, as written, is incorrect (invalid).**",

Consequently,\n\n> `\u00acSprandle(a)`.\n\n#### 4. Existence of a glurble that is not a sprandle\n\nWe have found an individual `a` such that\n\n> `Glurble(a)` **and** `\u00acSprandle(a)`.\n\nTherefore, the existential claim in the conclusion is satisfied:\n\n> \u2203x (\u202fGlurble(x) \u2227 \u00acSprandle(x)\u202f).\n\n---\n\n### Logical Form\n\nThe argument follows a standard **valid syllogistic pattern**:\n\n1. **Some A are B.**\u2003\u2003\u2003(\u2203x\u202fA(x)\u202f\u2227\u202fB(x))\n2. **No C are B.**\u2003\u2003\u2003(\u2200x\u202f(C(x)\u202f\u2192\u202f\u00acB(x)))\n3. **Therefore, some A are not C.**\u2003(\u2203x\u202fA(x)\u202f\u2227\u202f\u00acC(x))\n\nThis pattern is always valid: the existence of an \u201cA that is B\u201d together with the impossibility of \u201cC being B\u201d forces that particular A to be not C.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises necessarily entail the conclusion (no counter\u2011example can make the premises true while the conclusion false), the syllogism is **correct**.",

Caveat: soundness vs. validity\n\n- **Validity**: The argument structure guarantees the truth of the conclusion if the premises are true.  \n  *The syllogism is valid.*\n\n- **Soundness**: Depends on whether the premises are actually true in the real world.  \n  Suppose we think, \u201cTables are typically pieces of furniture\u201d \u2013 that conflicts with *Premise\u202f1*. So in reality the premises might be false, meaning the argument would be **unsound**.  \n  *This distinction doesn\u2019t affect validity, only soundness.*\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The syllogism is **correct (valid)**; it follows logically that \u201csome tables are not pieces of furniture\u201d from the two given premises.",

Review of categorical\u2011logic formulation\n\nIf we view the syllogism in classical categorical terms:\n\n- **Premise\u202f1**: *Some* tables *are* attractive things \u2192 **I\u2011statement** (S is P).  \n- **Premise\u202f2**: *No* pieces of furniture *are* attractive things  \u2192 **E\u2011statement** (M is P).  \n- **Conclusion**: *Some* tables *are not* pieces of furniture \u2192 **O\u2011statement** (S is not M).\n\nChecking with the standard figure/mood table:\n\n| Figure | Position of the middle term |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| 4 | Predicate in both premises |\n\nFor figure\u202f4 the only valid moods that involve an **I** premise are **I\u202fE\u202fO** (the form we have).  \nHence the syllogism satisfies one of the *valid* patterns (sometimes called \u201cminor premise, major premise\u201d form in figure\u202f4).  \nTherefore it is **logically valid**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Soundness and possible objections\n\n- **Soundness** requires that the premises are actually true in the real world.  \n  They are not contradictory if we do **not** assume that all tables are pieces of furniture.  \n  It's entirely possible (and consistent with the premises) that tables are not furniture\u2014e.g., \u201ctables\u201d could be a separate category of objects.\n\n- **Common\u2011sense objection**: In everyday language we usually consider tables to be furniture.  \n  Under that tacit assumption the premises would be contradictory (since \u201csome tables are attractive\u201d would clash with \u201cno furniture is attractive\u201d).  \n  However, logical validity is independent of that common\u2011sense assumption.\n\nBecause the argument is valid regardless of whether tables are furniture, **the syllogism is correct**. It provides a legitimate deduction from the given premises.",

In set\u2011language:  \n  \\[C \\cap B \\neq \\varnothing.\\]\n\nFrom these two facts we can deduce:\n\n1. Because \\(A \\cap B = \\varnothing\\), **no object that is a snorky thing can be a piece of blemble**.  \n2. The object guaranteed by Premise\u202f2 is a snorky thing. Therefore that object *cannot* be a piece of blemble.  \n3. Consequently, there is at least one flable that is **not** a piece of blemble.

According to the rule above, the middle term is in the same part of speech in **both** premises \u2013 it is never the subject. Therefore the syllogism violates the basic structural requirement for a legitimate categorical syllogism.\n\nBecause the structure is invalid, the inference \u201csome violins are not musical instruments\u201d does not logically follow in the strict sense of categorical syllogistic logic, even though it turns out to be logically derivable from the two premises if we interpret them as ordinary logical statements. For purposes of a classical syllogism this arrangement is **not permissible**, so we call the syllogism **incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n### Quick logical check (for intuition)\n\nIf we treat the premises as ordinary statements:\n\n1. \u2200x (MusicalInstrument(x) \u2192 \u00acShiny(x))\n2. \u2203y (Violin(y) \u2227 Shiny(y))\n\nFrom (1) we know there is **no** object that is both a musical instrument and shiny.  \nBut from (2) there exists a shiny violin.  \nThus that shiny violin cannot be a musical instrument, which gives\n\n\u2203z (Violin(z) \u2227 \u00acMusicalInstrument(z))\n\nSo logically the conclusion does follow.  \nThe problem, however, is that **the argument does not meet the syntactic criteria of a valid categorical syllogism** \u2013 the middle term is improperly positioned.

Apply Premise\u00a01 to the object found in Premise\u00a02\n\nFrom **Premise\u00a02** we know\n\n\u2203x ( Vi(x) \u2227 Sh(x) )  \n\u2014there is at least one x that is both a violin and shiny.\n\nUsing Premise\u202f1, for that same x we may infer\n\n\u00acMi(x)\u2003(because Sh(x) \u2192 \u00acMi(x))\n\n### 4. Summarise the implication\n\nThus we have found a particular object that satisfies\n\nVi(x)  \u2227  \u00acMi(x)\n\nwhich precisely means\n\n> **Some violins are not musical instruments.**\n\n### 5. Check by categorical logic rules\n\n| Concept | Analysis |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Distribution** | The middle term \u201cshiny\u201d is distributed in Premise\u202f1 (universal negative). |\n| **Quantifiers** | Premise\u202f2 provides existence of a shiny violin. Premise\u202f1 allows us to assign \u201cnot a musical instrument\u201d to every shiny object. |\n| **Conclusion form** | \u201cSome C are not A\u201d (existential negative) follows the standard rule of the **\u201cafflictive\u201d** (or \u201cSAS\u201d\u2011type) syllogism. |\n| **Validity** | No alternative interpretation can satisfy both premises while falsifying the conclusion. |\n\n---\n\n## Result\n\nBecause the conclusion **\u201csome violins are not musical instruments\u201d** is forced by the premises, the syllogism is logically **correct** (valid). It is a straightforward exemplification of how an existential statement about a subclass (shiny violins) combined with a universal statement about that subclass (no musical instruments are shiny) yields an existential negative conclusion about the subclass (some violins are not musical instruments).",

Apply **modus ponens** to the existential instance\n\nFrom the universal conditional (\\(I(x) \\rightarrow \\neg W(x)\\)) and the particular existence (\\(\\exists x (J(x) \\land I(x))\\)), we can instantiate the conditional for that particular person who is both a judge and impartial.  \nLet that person be \\(a\\).

Hence, by the rules of traditional categorical syllogisms, the argument is **valid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Summary\n\n1. *No well\u2011educated people are impartial* \u2192 *All impartial people are not well\u2011educated* (contrapositive).  \n2. *Some judges are impartial* guarantees an existing judge who is impartial.  \n3.

No existential fallacy type\u2011I (invalid lack of existence) applies.\n\n2. **Figure**: The minor term **J** is the subject of the conclusion and predicative of the middle term in Premise\u202f2, so we are in **Figure 3** (the arrangement is: 1\u2011E (major\u2013middle), 2\u2011I (minor\u2013middle)).\n\n3. **Mood\u2011Figure pairing**:  \n   The (E, I) pairing in Figure\u202f3 yields the valid syllogism **EII\u20113** (or its equivalent **EII\u20113/14** depending on the table). This mood is known to be valid.\n\nThus, label\u2011by\u2011label the syllogism passes all formal tests: no fallacy of quantity, the quality of the middle term is confirmed, the conclusion\u2019s form matches the mood\u2011figure, and the existence requirements are met.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Intuitive (semantic) justification\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that the conclusion is false: \u201cNo judge is not well\u2011educated,\u201d i.e., **every** judge is well\u2011educated.  \n- Then every impartial judge (because some judges are impartial) would have to be well\u2011educated.  \n- But Premise\u202f1 states that *no* well\u2011educated are impartial.  \n- Hence we obtain a contradiction.  \n\nTherefore, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. That is, the syllogism is logically valid.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom line\n\n- **Premise\u202f1** guarantees that **impartiality** and **well\u2011educatedness** are disjoint categories.  \n- **Premise\u202f2** guarantees that **some** judges belong to the category of **impartial**.  \n- Combining the two, those particular judges *must* fall outside the well\u2011educated category, which is precisely what the conclusion states.\n\nHence the syllogism is **valid (correct)**.",

Translating the premises into predicate logic\n\n| Original sentence | Predicate\u2011logic form |\n|--------------------|----------------------|\n| **Premise\u202f1** \u2013 Some judges are impartial. | **\u2203x (Judge(x) \u2227 Impartial(x))** |\n| **Premise\u202f2** \u2013 No well\u2011educated people are impartial. | **\u2200x (WellEducated(x) \u2192 \u00acImpartial(x))**  (equivalently  **\u00ac\u2203x (WellEducated(x) \u2227 Impartial(x))**) |\n| **Conclusion** \u2013 Some judges are not well\u2011educated people. | **\u2203x (Judge(x) \u2227 \u00acWellEducated(x))** |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the conclusion follows (logical validity)\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1** tells us that there is at least one individual, say *j*, such that  \n   `Judge(j)` and `Impartial(j)` are both true.\n\n2. **Premise\u202f2** tells us that *no* individual who is well\u2011educated can be impartial.  \n   In logical terms: for every *x*, if `WellEducated(x)` is true, then `Impartial(x)` must be false.\n\n3. Applying Premise\u202f2 to the particular individual *j* whose impartiality we already know:  \n   Because `Impartial(j)` is true, Premise\u202f2 forces `WellEducated(j)` to be false (otherwise it'd contradict the universal restriction).\n\n4. Thus we have found an individual *j* such that  \n   `Judge(j)` **and** `\u00acWellEducated(j)` are true.\n\n5. Statement\u202f4 is exactly the conclusion: **there exists a judge who is **not** well\u2011educated**.\n\nHence the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises \u2013 the syllogism is **valid (sound if the premises are true)**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why it is not a *categorical* syllogism in the classical sense\n\nClassical categorical syllogisms are strictly of the form:\n\n```\n          Major premise (PP)\n          Minor premise (PP)\n          \u2234 Conclusion (PP)\n```\n\nwhere \u201cPP\u201d denotes a categorical proposition (A, E, I, O).  \nThe **middle term** must appear as the *subject* in at least one premise and *cannot* be the *predicate* in both premises (rule of distribution).  \n\nLet the terms be:\n\n| Term | Interpretation |\n|------|----------------|\n| **S** | Judges |\n| **M** | Well\u2011educated |\n| **P** | Impartial |\n\nThe syllogism reads:\n\n```\nPremise\u202f1: Some S are P.          (I)\nPremise\u202f2: No M are P.            (E)\n\u2234 Some S are not M.               (O)\n```\n\nIn this arrangement **P is the middle term** (appearing in both premises), but it is the *predicate* in **both** premises:\n\n- In Premise\u202f1, P is the predicate (\u201cSome S are P\u201d).\n- In Premise\u202f2, P is also the predicate (\u201cNo M are P\u201d).\n\nBecause a categorical syllogism cannot have the middle term as the predicate in *both* premises, this form violates the \u201cillicit major/minor\u201d rule. Consequently, it is **not a valid categorical syllogism** under the classical rules.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bottom line\n\n| View | Verdict |\n|------|---------|\n| Predicate\u2011logic (ordinary logic) | **Valid** (the conclusion follows from the premises) |\n| Classical categorical syllogism | **Invalid** (middle term in predicate position in both premises) |\n\nSo, if you\u2019re checking *logical validity* in the broad sense, the syllogism is correct.

Bottom line\n\n- **Validity** \u2013 correct. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.  \n- **Soundness** \u2013 not in the world, because Premise\u202f2 is false in practice; but the argument\u2019s form is still logically correct.\n\nSo **the syllogism is correct (valid)**.",

Thus, \u201cSome spindles are not druffs\u201d holds.\n\nAny model that satisfies the two premises must contain at least one spindle that is bliving. That spindle cannot belong to the set of druffs (because druffs cannot be bliving). Therefore **the conclusion will automatically be true in all models**\u2014the argument is sound and valid.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Counters and pitfalls\n\n| Counter\u2011example idea | Why it fails |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n| All spindles are druffs | If each spindle that is bliving were also a druff, that spindle would simultaneously be bliving and non\u2011bliving (contradicting Premise\u202f1). |\n| No spindles exist | Premise\u202f2 asserts the existence of at least one spindle. |\n| Some spindles are bliving, none anti\u2011druff | But the spindle that is bliving must be *outside* the set of druffs, because druffs cannot be bliving. |\n\nThus no admissible assignment of truth values can make the premises true while the conclusion false.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Call it *x*.  \n2. **From P2**: no object that is a druff can be a bliving thing.  \n3. Since *x* is a bliving thing (by (1)) and a spindle, (*x* cannot be a druff). If *x* were a druff, it would be a bliving thing, contradicting (2).  \n4. Therefore, *x* is a spindle that is **not** a druff.  \n5. Consequently, **there exists** a spindle that is not a druff \u2013 i.e., \u201cSome spindles are not druffs\u201d is true.\n\n---\n\n#### Contraposition argument (quick check)\n\nAssume the opposite of the conclusion: *all* spindles are druffs. Then any spindle that is a bliving thing would be a druff, and hence a bliving thing. This contradicts premise 2 (No druffs are bliving things). So the supposition fails, forcing the conclusion to hold.\n\n---\n\n### Formally recognized pattern\n\nIn categorical syllogistic notation this has the mood:\n\n- **Premise 1**: AII (Some S are B)  \n- **Premise 2**: EIO (No D are B)  \n\nThe conclusion is an **I** statement: **Some S are not D** (I type: particular affirmative).\n\nThe mood **AII, EIO \u2192 I** is one of the six classic valid Syllogistic forms, ensuring that the conclusion necessarily follows from the given premises.\n\n---\n\n**Hence, the syllogism is correct.**",

Translate the sentences into categorical forms\n\n| Sentence | Form | Interpretation |\n|----------|------|----------------|\n| **Premise\u202f1** \u2013 Some spindles are bliving things. | **I** | *Some* **S** (spindles) **are** **B** (bliving). |\n| **Premise\u202f2** \u2013 No druffs are bliving things. | **E** | *No* **D** (druffs) **are** **B** (bliving). |\n| **Conclusion** \u2013 Some spindles are not druffs. | **O** | *Some* **S** (spindles) **are not** **D** (druffs). |\n\nThus the mood of the syllogism is **I\u202fE**, and the figure is decided by the position of the middle term **B**.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Identify the figure\n\n- In Premise\u202f1 the middle term **B** is the predicate:  \n  \\[ \\text{I S B} \\quad (S\\; \\text{\u2192 predicate}) \\]\n- In Premise\u202f2 **B** is also the predicate:  \n  \\[ \\text{E D B} \\quad (D\\; \\text{\u2192 predicate}) \\]\n\nBoth premises have the middle term as the predicate.  \nThat is **Figure\u202f3** (predicate\u2013predicate).\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Check the distribution of terms in the premises\n\n| Term | Premise\u202f1 | Premise\u202f2 |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| **S** (spindle) | not distributed (subject of an *I*) | (does not appear) |\n| **D** (druff)   | (does not appear) | not distributed (subject of an *E*) |\n| **B** (bliving) | not distributed (predicate of an *I*) | not distributed (predicate of an *E*) |\n\nImportant points:\n\n* In a categorical syllogism, a term is *distributed* if it is the subject of a universal proposition (**A** or **E**) or the predicate of a particular proposition (**O**).  \n* Neither **S** nor **D** is distributed in any premise.  \n* The middle term **B** is never distributed (it is the predicate of both premises).\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Distribution in the conclusion\n\n| Term | Conclusion |\n|------|------------|\n| **S** | Distributed (subject of an **O**) |\n| **D** | Not distributed |\n| **B** | (does not appear) |\n\nThe conclusion has **S** distributed, whereas **S** was *not* distributed in any premise.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  The \u201cDistribution Rule\u201d (also called the *Rule of Distribution* or the *Validity of Terms*)\n\n> **Rule of Distribution** \u2013 A term may be distributed in the conclusion **only if it was distributed in at least one premise.**\n\nBecause **S** is distributed in the conclusion but never in the premises, the argument *fails* the distribution rule. Consequently, as a classical categorical syllogism, it is **invalid** (i.e., we call it an \u201cincorrect\u201d syllogism).\n\n---\n\n### 6.  Why the argument is *logically* valid, yet categorically invalid\n\nIn ordinary first\u2011order logic we can formulate the premises as:\n\n1. \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Bx)  \u2003(*Some spindles are bliving.*)  \n2. \u2200x (Bx \u2192 \u00acDx)\u2003(*No druffs are bliving.*)\n\nFrom these two, we can infer:\n\n\u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acDx)\u2003(*Some spindle is not a druff.*)\n\nThus the argument is *logically correct* \u2013 the set of premises implies the conclusion.  \n\nThe categorical framework, however, imposes the distribution rule. Because that rule is *not a logical requirement* (it is a *metalogical* restriction used in Aristotelian syllogistic analysis), the syllogism is *syntactically* invalid in that system, hence \u201cincorrect\u201d in the classical sense.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n**If you are using the standard rules for categorical syllogisms, the syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**  \nIf you treat the premises as ordinary first\u2011order quantifications, the inference is valid, but it would not be accepted as a \u201cproper\u201d syllogism in the Aristotelian sense.",

Deduce the conclusion\n\n1. From Premise\u202f2, there is at least one individual \\(a\\) such that  \n   \\[\n   P(a)\\land M(a)\n   \\]\n2. Premise\u202f1 tells us that if an individual is religious, then that individual cannot be married.  \n   Formally:  \n   \\[\n   \\forall x \\bigl(R(x)\\to\\lnot M(x)\\bigr)\n   \\]\n   Equivalently, **no** individual can be *both* religious **and** married.\n\n3. Apply Premise\u202f1 to the specific individual \\(a\\) found in step\u202f1.  \n   Since \\(M(a)\\) holds, the only way the rule \u201c\\(R(x)\\to \\lnot M(x)\\)\u201d can remain true is if \\(R(a)\\) is *false* (negated).  \n   In other words, \\(a\\) **cannot** be a religious person: \\(\\lnot R(a)\\).\n\n4. Combine the facts we have about \\(a\\) now:  \n   \\[\n   P(a)\\land \\lnot R(a)\n   \\]\n   This shows that **there exists** at least one individual who is a priest and not a religious person.\n\n5. Therefore we can assert the conclusion:\n   \\[\n   \\exists x\\,(P(x)\\land \\lnot R(x))\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### 4. A quick check using natural language\n\n*Premise\u202f1* tells us:  \n> \"Any religious person cannot be married.\"\n\n*Premise\u202f2* gives us:  \n> \"There is at least one priest who is married.\"\n\nIf that married priest were also a religious person, Premise\u202f1 would be violated.  \nHence that married priest *must* *not* be a religious person.  \nThus, *there exists* a priest who is not a religious person.\n\nThat is exactly the conclusion we derived.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe syllogism is **logically sound** (valid); the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\n- **Premise 1**: \u00ac\u2203x (R\u202f\u2227\u202fM)  (No religious are married)  \n- **Premise 2**: \u2203x (P\u202f\u2227\u202fM)  (Some priests are married)  \n- **Conclusion**: \u2203x (P\u202f\u2227\u202f\u00acR) (Some priests are not religious)\n\nThe inference is valid, so the syllogism is *correct*.",

Quick sanity check\n\nAssume the premises are true.  \nPick one thrumpet that is snorbled (guaranteed by the first premise).  \nBecause no krimble thing is snorbled (given second premise), that particular thrumpet cannot be a krimble thing.  \nThus there *is* at least one thrumpet that is not a krimble thing.  \nThat is exactly what the conclusion asserts.\n\nThere is no way to satisfy both premises while violating the conclusion, so the syllogism is free of contradiction and hence valid.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The syllogism is logically correct.

Logical Consequence\n\nWe want to see whether the two premises\u2014\\(\\exists x\\, (T(x)\\wedge S(x))\\) and \\(\\forall x\\, (K(x)\\rightarrow \\neg S(x))\\)\u2014logically entail the conclusion \\(\\exists x\\, (T(x)\\wedge \\neg K(x))\\).\n\n1. **From the first premise** we know that there is some element (call it **a**) such that  \n   \\[\n   T(a)\\wedge S(a)\n   \\]\n2. **From the second premise**, using the contrapositive of the universal statement, we have:  \n   \\[\n   \\forall x\\, (S(x)\\rightarrow \\neg K(x))\n   \\]\n   (because \u201cif \\(K(y)\\) then not \\(S(y)\\)\u201d is equivalent to \u201cif \\(S(y)\\) then not \\(K(y)\\)\u201d by contraposition).\n3. Apply this contrapositive to the element **a**: since \\(S(a)\\) holds, it follows that \\(\\neg K(a)\\).\n4. Combine the two facts about **a**:  \n   \\[\n   T(a)\\wedge S(a) \\wedge \\neg K(a)\n   \\]\n   In particular, \\(T(a)\\wedge \\neg K(a)\\) holds.\n\n5. Therefore there exists an element satisfying \\(T(x)\\wedge \\neg K(x)\\), i.e.,  \n   \\[\n   \\exists x\\,(T(x)\\wedge \\neg K(x)).\n   \\]\n\nThus the conclusion *is* a logical consequence of the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Categorical\u2011Logic View\n\nIf we view the syllogism in the classic categorical style, we have:\n\n```\n1. Some S are M.        (I premise: some thrumpets are snorbled)\n2. No P are M.          (E premise: no krimble things are snorbled)\nConclusion: Some S are not P.   (O conclusion: some thrumpets are not krimble things)\n```\n\nThe mood of the syllogism is **IEO** (I\u2013E\u2013O).  \nThe axioms of categorical logic guarantee that an **IEO** two\u2011premise syllogism is valid. The existence of at least one S (from premise\u202f1) guarantees that the conclusion is meaningful (no existence\u2011fallacies).  \n\nSo from a pedagogical standpoint, this syllogism is both logically sound and formally correct.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Quick Intuitive Check\n\nThink of *thrumpets*\u202f=\u202fcats, *snorbled*\u202f=\u202fwhite, *krimble things*\u202f=\u202fbirds.  \n- Premise\u202f1: Some cats are white.  \n- Premise\u202f2: No birds are white.  \nIt follows that at least one cat is a cat that is *not* a bird \u2013 which is obviously true.  \nThis intuitive example matches the formal proof.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nBecause\n\n1. the two premises are consistent and together imply the existence of a thrumpet that is not a krimble thing, and  \n2. the categorical\u2011logic mood **IEO** is a recognized valid form,\n\nthe syllogism is **correct**.

The logical structure\n\nThe two premises give us:\n\n1. **Existence of a member of the \u201cthrumpet\u201d class that belongs to the \u201csnorbled\u201d class** (call this element `a`).  \n2. **No member of the \u201ckrimble\u201d class can belong to the \u201csnorbled\u201d class**.\n\nThe conclusion we need is: *there exists a thrumpet that does **not** belong to the \u201ckrimble\u201d class*.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Proof by contradiction (or contraposition)\n\nAssume the opposite of what we want to prove:  \n> *All thrumpets are krimble*  \n> (i.e., \u2200x (Thrumpet(x) \u2192 Krimble(x))).\n\nIf all thrumpets were krimble, then the thrumpet `a` that is snorbled would also be krimble.  \nBut premise\u202f2 tells us that **no krimble can be snorbled**.  \nThat gives us a contradiction:\n\n```\na is snorbled  \u2227  a is krimble  (by assumption)\n\u00ac(a is snorbled) \u2227 (a is krimble)  (by Premise\u202f2)\n```\n\nHence the assumption that *all thrumpets are krimble* must be false.  \nTherefore there exists at least one thrumpet that **is not** krimble, establishing the conclusion:\n\n```\n\u2203x (Thrumpet(x) \u2227 \u00acKrimble(x))\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Classical categorical\u2011logic check\n\nUsing the standard forms of categorical reasoning:\n\n| Premise | Form | Middle term |\n|---------|------|-------------|\n| \u2203 S M  | **I** | *M* |\n| \u2200 P \u00acM | **E** | *M* |\n| \u2234 \u2203 S \u00acP | **O** | *\u00acP* |\n\nThe premises are **mixed** (one positive, one negative).  \nIn classical categorical logic, the combination I+E yielding O is a **valid** rule of inference because the existence forced by the first premise combined with the universal restriction of the second antecedent guarantees the impossibility of all S being P, thereby ensuring that some S are not P.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary of the logical flow\n\n1. Premise\u202f1 guarantees at least one thrumpet that is snorbled.  \n2. Premise\u202f2 tells us that *no* krimble can be snorbled.  \n3. Therefore, the snorbled thrumpet cannot be a krimble.  \n4. Since that thrumpet is a thrumpet, we have found a thrumpet that is **not** a krimble.  \n5. This exactly matches the conclusion: *Some thrumpets are not krimble things.*\n\n---\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nBecause the premises logically enforce the conclusion, **the syllogism is valid**.

Derivation (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n1.

From **P\u2082** we can instantiate the universal statement at the same individual \\(a\\):  \n   \\[\n   V(a)\\rightarrow \\neg G(a)\n   \\]  \n   (Universal Instantiation).\n\n3. Since \\(V(a)\\) is true, modus ponens gives  \n   \\[\n   \\neg G(a)\n   \\]  \n\n4. Combining with \\(D(a)\\) from step\u202f1, we have  \n   \\[\n   D(a)\\land \\neg G(a)\n   \\]\n\n5.

That means the argument **does not belong** to any of the classic \u201cvalid moods and figures\u201d in the Aristotelian system.  \n\nNevertheless, in first\u2011order logic the premises are compatible and together guarantee the conclusion. The difficulty is purely arithmetical: the classical syllogistic framework is simply not expressive enough to capture the way the middle term is used in this particular argument.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Why it\u2019s not a false argument\n\n* **Consistency**: The premises are not contradictory. They can all be true simultaneously (e.g., a vegetarian diver who is not a good swimmer).\n* **Non\u2011triviality**: The conclusion is **not** a logical consequence of either premise alone; it requires the combination of both.

Apply Premise\u202f1 to that same object\n\nPremise\u202f1 says: if an object is *plimby*, it cannot be *fruggle*.  \nNegating the consequent gives the contrapositive:\n\n```\n\u00acfruggle(x)  \u2192  \u00acplimby(x)\n```\n\nBut *a* **is** fruggle (*fruggle(a)*), so we cannot have \u00acfruggle(a).  \nThus the implication above tells us precisely **not** that *a* is plimby\u2014**but** that *a* cannot be plimby because if it were, it would violate Premise\u202f1.\n\nIn short: from fruggle(*a*) and the universal statement \u201cplimby \u2192 \u00acfruggle\u201d we deduce:\n\n```\n\u00acplimby(a)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4.

No logical fallacy arises here because:\n\n- The first premise guarantees at least one vitamin tablet is expensive.\n- The second premise forbids any nutritional thing from being expensive.\n- Hence that expensive vitamin tablet cannot be nutritional, establishing the conclusion.\n\nThus, based on formal logic and standard syllogistic analysis, **the syllogism is correct**.",

From premise\u202f1, pick an arbitrary individual \\(a\\) that satisfies \\(V(a)\\land E(a)\\) (Existential Instantiation).\n\n2. Premise\u202f2 says that for **every** \\(x\\), if \\(N(x)\\) then \\(\\neg E(x)\\).  \n   Apply it to \\(x=a\\):  \n   \\[\n   N(a)\\; \\rightarrow\\; \\neg E(a)\n   \\]\n\n3. The contrapositive of the implication in (2) is equivalent:  \n   \\[\n   E(a)\\; \\rightarrow\\; \\neg N(a)\n   \\]\n\n   Since we know \\(E(a)\\) from step\u202f1, we may conclude \\(\\neg N(a)\\).\n\n4. We now have both \\(V(a)\\) (from step\u202f1) and \\(\\neg N(a)\\) (from step\u202f3).  \n   Hence \\(V(a)\\land\\neg N(a)\\).\n\n5. Finally, by Existential Generalization, we obtain  \n   \\[\n   \\exists x\\;(V(x)\\land \\neg N(x))\n   \\]\n   which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nThus the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The syllogism is **valid**.\n\n---\n\n## Why intuition matches the formal proof\n\nThe syllogism is simply asserting that:\n\n* If there exists an expensive vitamin tablet, and\n* No nutritional thing is expensive,\n\nthen **that** expensive vitamin tablet cannot be a nutritional thing. Therefore, at least one vitamin tablet is not a nutritional thing.\n\nThis is the classic syllogistic pattern:\n\n1. *Some*\u202fA\u202fare\u202fB.\n2. *No*\u202fC\u202fare\u202fB.\n3. *Therefore*, *some*\u202fA\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fC.\n\nIt is one of the six standard valid moods (specifically, *InE* \u2013 *Many* \u2192 *No* \u2192 *Many*).  \n\nSo the syllogism is logically sound.",

The premises only speak about two **different\ngroups of objects**:\n\n* Premise\u202f1 says every electric appliance is *non\u2011metallic*.\n* Premise\u202f2 says *some* video recorders are *metallic*.\n\nNo statement is made about:\n\n* Whether electric appliances exist at all.\n* Whether any electric appliance could also be a video recorder.\n* Whether any electric appliance is *not* a video recorder.\n\nBecause the premises make **no claim** about the intersection of\nelectric appliances and video recorders, the existence of at least one\n\u201celectric appliance that is not a video recorder\u201d cannot be\nconcluded.  The conclusion is **logically independent** of the\npremises.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Visualise with a Venn diagram\n\n| Diagram | Observation |\n|---------|-------------|\n| \u274c  | The circle for \u201celectric appliances\u201d lies entirely outside the circle for \u201cmetal things\u201d (Premise\u202f1). |\n| \u26a0\ufe0f  | The circle for \u201cvideo recorders\u201d overlaps the \u201cmetal things\u201d circle (Premise\u202f2). |\n| \u2b1c  | The overlap between \u201celectric appliances\u201d and \u201cvideo recorders\u201d is *not* forced to exist.  It could be empty. |\n\nWith the \u201celectric appliances\u201d circle and the \u201cvideo recorders\u201d circle\ndisjoint, the conclusion \u201cSome electric appliances are not video recorders\u201d\nis *trivially true* in that case.  But if we collapse the \u201celectric\nappliance\u201d circle to a single point none of which are video recorders,\nthe conclusion still holds.  Hence without further premises, the\nconclusion does **not follow**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom line\n\n* The syllogism **fails the distribution rule for the middle term**  \n  (Figure\u202f3, mood\u202fE\u202fI\u202fO).  \n* The premises provide no logical support for the conclusion.\n\n**Therefore, the syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**",

Therefore this form is not a valid syllogistic mood.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Why the middle term is not properly linked\n\nFor a categorical syllogism to be valid, the middle term must appear **once as the subject** and **once as the predicate** of the two premises.  \nHere the middle term (*Crunchy*, \u201cC\u201d) appears as **predicate** in both premises:\n\n1. \u201cNo sparkle **are crunchy**.\u201d  (C is predicate)  \n2. \u201cSome whizzlers **are crunchy**.\u201d (C is predicate)\n\nBecause it never appears as subject in either premise, the middle term does not \u201cconnect\u201d the subject (sparkle) and the predicate (whizzler). Hence the syllogism fails the which-term rule.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe premises do **not** entail the conclusion; therefore the syllogism is logically incorrect. The form **E\u202fI\u202fO** is not a valid Aristotelian mood, and the middle term is not properly positioned, so the argument is invalid.",

Call that person \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Premise\u202f2** says *no* healthy person can be athletic. Hence, any person who is athletic is *not* healthy. In particular, the astronaut \\(a\\) is *not* healthy.\n\n   But this is the only fact we gain: we now know that there is at least one **unhealthy** astronaut. Nothing follows about the existence of healthy people at all, nor about the relationship between healthy people and astronauts.\n\n3. The conclusion demands that **there exists a healthy person who is not an astronaut**.\n\n   The premises give *no* guarantee of the existence of any healthy person, let alone *a healthy person who is not* an astronaut.  \n\n   - It may be that **no** healthy person exists, in which case the conclusion is literally false.\n   - Even if a healthy person does exist, the premises are silent about whether that person could also be an astronaut, so the conclusion is not forced.\n\nTherefore the inference from the two premises to the conclusion is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## Checking with classical categorical syllogism rules  \n\nRe\u2011frame the syllogism using the standard A/E/I/O terms with *S* = subject, *P* = predicate.\n\n| Position | Statement | A/E/I/O | S | P |\n|----------|-----------|---------|---|---|\n| **Major** | No healthy people are athletic | E | C\uff08healthy\uff09 | B\uff08athletic\uff09 |\n| **Minor** | Some astronauts are athletic | I | A\uff08astronaut\uff09 | B\uff08athletic\uff09 |\n| **Conclusion** | Some healthy people are not astronauts | O | C | A |\n\nSo the form is **I\u202fE\u202fO** (Minor I, Major E, Conclusion O) in *Figure\u202f1* (i.e., both premises share the middle term \u201cathletic\u201d).  \nAmong the 19 historically recognized valid forms (ALLI\u202f1\u20116, EAE\u202f1\u20116, etc.), **none** has the pattern *I\u202fE\u202fO* in Figure\u202f1. In the traditional syllogistic system, that form is invalid \u2013 it does not satisfy the implicit or explicit existence or distribution requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Counter\u2011example\n\nA simple counter\u2011example that satisfies both premises but violates the conclusion:\n\n| Person | Astronaut | Athletic | Healthy |\n|--------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Bob | \u2714\ufe0e | \u2714\ufe0e | \u2718 |\n| Alice | \u274c | \u2718 | \u2714\ufe0e |\n\n- **Premise\u202f1**: Bob is an astronaut and athletic \u21d2 \u201cSome astronauts are athletic\u201d. \u2713  \n- **Premise\u202f2**: Alice is healthy but not athletic. No healthy person is athletic holds. \u2713  \n- **Conclusion**: Is there a healthy person who is not an astronaut? Alice is healthy and not an astronaut, so the conclusion would actually be **true** in this model.  \n\nBut we can tweak the model to make the conclusion false while keeping the premises true. E.g.:\n\n| Person | Astronaut | Athletic | Healthy |\n|--------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Bob | \u2714\ufe0e | \u2714\ufe0e | \u2718 |\n| (no other people) | | | |\n\n- **Premise\u202f1**: Still true.  \n- **Premise\u202f2**: No healthy person exists, so \u201cno healthy people are athletic\u201d is vacuously true.  \n- **Conclusion**: There is **no** healthy person at all, let alone a healthy one who is not an astronaut. Hence the conclusion is false.\n\nThus we have a model where both premises hold but the conclusion does not \u2013 confirming the form\u2019s invalidity.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBecause the two premises do **not** logically entail the conclusion (neither by symbolic inference nor by categorical syllogism rules) the syllogism is **incorrect**. The intended inference fails because the premises do not provide any information about the existence or properties of healthy people.",

But the conclusion is a **particular** statement, so the distribution is wrong.\n\n4. **Rule of composition & contraposition**  \n   From \u201cNo\u202fA\u202fare\u202fG\u201d we can infer \u201cAll A are not G\u201d (i.e., All flumpy are not grible).  \n   From \u201cSome\u202fB\u202fare\u202fG\u201d we can infer nothing about the relationship between A and B; it merely says that at least one plonker *is* a grible.  \n   These two facts together give **no evidence** that any flumpy is *not* a plonker.  \n   The desired conclusion would require a \u201cmaterial conditional\u201d like \u201cIf something is flumpy, then it is not a plonker\u201d, which we have not established.\n\n---\n\n### Counter\u2011model\n\nConsider a universe with two individuals:\n\n| Individual | flumpy | plonker | grible |\n|------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| **x** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** |\n| **y** | No | Yes | Yes |\n\n- \u201cNo flumpy are grible\u201d holds: *x* is flumpy but not grible; *y* is not flumpy.  \n- \u201cSome plonkers are grible\u201d holds: *y* is a plonker and a grible.  \n- \u201cSome flumpy are not plonkers\u201d **fails**: the only flumpy (*x*) is also a plonker, so there is **no** flumpy that is not a plonker.\n\nHence the premises can be true while the conclusion is false, proving the syllogism is **not logically valid**.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe syllogism is **incorrect**\u2014the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

Syllogistic classification\n\nIn traditional categorical logic (Aristotle\u2019s syllogisms), a valid form must follow one of the accepted moods and figures, and the middle term must appear at least twice in the premises and **must appear in the conclusion**.  \n\nHere:\n\n- The middle term would be **grible** (it appears in both premises).  \n- **The conclusion has no reference to \u201cgrible.\u201d**\n\nBecause the conclusion omits the middle term, the argument does not even satisfy the basic syntactic constraints of a valid categorical syllogism. This is a *structural mistake*, and even ignoring that, the logical content is invalid (as shown in the counter\u2011example).\n\n### 4. Final verdict\n\nThe syllogism is **invalid** (incorrect). The two premises do not provide sufficient reason to reach the conclusion \u201csome flumpy things are not plonkers.\u201d The reasoning pattern is not one of the valid Aristotelian moods and figures, and the inference is demonstrably false in a counter\u2011example.",

The premises are **contradictory**\n\nIn ordinary commonsense semantics a *skyscraper* is a kind of *building* (i.e. Skyscraper \u2286 Building).  Under that subsumption the two premises cannot both be true:\n\n* Premise\u202f1 says \u201cthere is a building that is wooden\u201d.\n* Premise\u202f2 says \u201cno building is wooden\u201d.\n\nThus there is **no model** that satisfies both premises.  In classical logic a set of contradictory premises is *inconsistent*, and a conclusion cannot be said to follow from them in the intended way.\n\n#### 2.  The conclusion does **not** logically follow\n\nEven if we ignore the implicit subsumption Skyscraper \u2286 Building, we can still find a model that satisfies both premises but falsifies the conclusion:\n\n* Domain = {\u202fa,\u202fb\u202f}\n* Skyscrapers = {\u202fa\u202f}\n* Buildings   = {\u202fb\u202f}\n* Wooden things = {\u202fa\u202f}\n\n*Premise\u202f1*: At least one skyscraper (a) is wooden \u2013 true.  \n*Premise\u202f2*: No building is wooden \u2013 true (b is a building, but it is not wooden).  \n*Conclusion*: \u201cSome buildings are not skyscrapers\u201d is false when there are no buildings at all (or when every building happens to be a skyscraper).  (In the example above, there is a building (b) that is not a skyscraper, so the conclusion is actually true.  But we can make the conclusion false by letting the single building be a skyscraper as well.)\n\nThe point is that *the conclusion is not forced* by the premises.  The entailment fails simply because the premises never coexist in a real world.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Validity** requires that *in every interpretation* in which all premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  \n- Since the premises are actually mutually exclusive (or at least do not force the conclusion), the syllogism **fails the validity test**.  \n\nTherefore, the syllogism is **incorrect** (invalid).",

Does the conclusion necessarily hold?\n\nThe conclusion says: *There exists at least one building that is **not** a skyscraper.*  \nIn logical notation: \\(\\exists y\\,(Building(y) \\land \\lnot Skyscraper(y))\\).\n\nThis is a **particular** statement (an existential claim).  \nTo prove it valid, the premises must force the existence of such an object.\n\n### Counter\u2011model\n\nConsider a domain containing the following individuals:\n\n|             | Skyscraper | Building | Wooden |\n|-------------|------------|----------|--------|\n| **a**       | yes        | yes      | **no** |\n| **b**       | yes        | **no**   | yes    |\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `a` is both a building and a skyscraper, but not wooden (fits Premise\u202f2).  \n* `b` is a wooden skyscraper but not a building (fits Premise\u202f1).  \n\nNow verify the premises:\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1**: `b` satisfies \u201cskyscraper & wooden\u201d. \u2714\ufe0f  \n2. **Premise\u202f2**: `a` is a building and not wooden, `b` is not a building \u2013 no building is wooden. \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nBut the conclusion **fails**: there is **no** building `y` such that `!Skyscraper(y)`. In the model all buildings are skyscrapers (the building `a` is a skyscraper). Hence the conclusion is false in this model, even though both premises are true.\n\nBecause we have found a **model** where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, the syllogism is **logically invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Find a counter\u2011model\n\nIf we can construct a situation in which\n\n1. both premises are true, **and**\n2. the conclusion is false,\n\nthen the syllogism is logically invalid.\n\nTake, for example, these sets:\n\n| Set | Elements |\n|-----|----------|\n| Blorpers          | \\(\\{1\\}\\) |\n| ClompenThings     | \\(\\{1\\}\\) |\n| Thribbles         | \\(\\varnothing\\) |\n\n*Premise\u202f1*:  \n\\(1\\) is in both Blorpers and ClompenThings \u2192 **true**.\n\n*Premise\u202f2*:  \nThere are no thribbles, so the statement \u201cno thribbles are clompen things\u201d is vacuously **true**.\n\n*Conclusion*:  \n\u201cThere exists a thribble that is not a blorper\u201d would require a member of Thribbles, but Thribbles is empty. Hence the conclusion is **false**.\n\nBecause the premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the syllogism is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  General categorical\u2011logic reasoning\n\nIn a standard categorical syllogism, valid forms can be checked by the *Square of Opposition* and the rules of categorical inference.  \nThe given pattern is:\n\n```\nSome S are P           (A sentence of type 'Some')\nNo M are P             (B sentence of type 'No')\n--------------------------------------------\nSome M are not S       (E sentence of type 'Some ... not')\n```\n\nNone of the classical valid syllogistic moods (e.g., Barbara, Celarent, Darii, etc.) matches this shape.  \nIn particular, there is **no** valid monotonic inference from \"Some S are P\" + \"No M are P\" to \"Some M are not S.\" The premises do not provide any existential or universal coupling between \\(M\\) and \\(S\\).\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Check what the premises actually assert  \n\n1. **Premise\u202f1** guarantees the *existence* of an object that is both a blorper and a clompen.  \n2. **Premise\u202f2** only tells us that if an object is a thribble, it cannot be a clompen.  \n   - It does **not** assert that any thribbles exist at all.  \n   - It does **not** relate thribbles to blorpers.  \n\nBecause of (2), the premises are satisfied in any universe that:\n\n* contains at least one blorper\u2011clompen object, and  \n* contains **no** thribbles **or** contains thribbles that are not clompen (which is allowed).\n\nThe crucial point: the existence of thribbles is **not** forced by the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Examine whether the conclusion follows  \n\nThe conclusion asserts two things:\n\n1. **Existence of thribbles** \u2013 \u201csome thribbles exist.\u201d  \n2. **A property of those thribbles** \u2013 \u201ceach such thribble is *not* a blorper.\u201d\n\nBecause the premises give no guarantee that any thribbles exist, we cannot derive the existence part.  \nEven if we assume there are thribbles, we still have no reason to think they must be non\u2011blorpers; the premises allow the possibility that every thribble *is* a blorper.\n\nThus the premises do **not** logically entail the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Construct an explicit counterexample  \n\nTake a very small universe:\n\n| Object | Blorper? | Clompen? | Thribble? |\n|--------|----------|----------|-----------|\n| \\(a\\) | yes | yes | no |\n| \\(b\\) | no | no | **no** |\n\n- **Premise\u202f1**: \\(a\\) is a blorper and a clompen \u2192 true.  \n- **Premise\u202f2**: There is *no* thribble that is a clompen \u2192 true (there are no thribbles at all).  \n- **Conclusion**: \u201cSome thribbles are not blorpers\u201d \u2192 false (because there are no thribbles at all, so \u201csome\u201d is impossible).\n\nBecause we have a model where premises are true and the conclusion is false, the syllogism is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Where can the eloquent classical syllogistic reasoning go wrong?  \n\nIn the traditional categorical logic framework:\n\n- **Figure 3, mood IEO** (Premise1: I, Premise2: E, Conclusion: O) is **not** one of the valid forms.  \n  - The only valid forms that end with an O\u2011statement (\u201csome S are not P\u201d) arise in specific figures where the middle term is both the subject of an E and the predicate of an I or E.  \n  - Here the middle term is **clompen** in both premises, but the conclusion refers to **thribbles** as subject and **blorpers** as predicate \u2013 the structure does not match any valid figure.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final verdict  \n\nBecause the premises do **not** establish the existence of thribbles (nor that those thribbles lack the blorper property), the argument fails to be logically valid.  \n\n**Therefore, the syllogism is incorrect.**",

Counter\u2011model that refutes validity\n\nLet\u2019s construct a simple interpretation:\n\n| Element | \\(B\\) (blorpers) | \\(T\\) (thribbles) | \\(C\\) (clompen) |\n|---------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| \\(a\\)   | true            | false              | true            |\n| \\(b\\)   | false           | false              | false           |\n\n* **Premise\u202f1**: \\(a\\) is both a bloper and a clompen \u2192 true.\n* **Premise\u202f2**: There are no thribbles (`T` empty). The universal statement \u201cfor all \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is a thribble then not clompen\u201d vacuously holds \u2192 true.\n* **Conclusion**: There is **no** element that is a thribble (`T` empty). The existential statement \u201cthere exists \\(x\\) that is a thribble and not a bloper\u201d is false.\n\nThus **both premises are true** while the **conclusion is false**, producing a valid counter\u2011model. Therefore, the argument is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Where the argument goes wrong\n\n- **Missing existential import on the minor term**: From \u201cNo thribbles are clompen things,\u201d we cannot deduce that any thribbles exist or that there exists a thribble that is not a bloper.   \n- **No logical link between the two categories**: The premises involve clompen objects, but the conclusion relates blorpers and thribbles; the categorical syllogism fails to connect them.  \n- **Distributivity and figure**: Even if we analyze it in classic Latin syllogistic terms, this form does not match any existing valid figure (e.g., it is not Barbara, Celarent, etc.). The middle term (clompen) is not adequately distributed in a way that supports the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do not guarantee the existence of thribbles, nor do they relate blorpers and thribbles, the syllogism **does not logically entail its conclusion**.\n\n**Hence the syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**",

Why the given conclusion does NOT follow\n\nThe claimed conclusion, *\u201cSome addictive things are not cigarettes,\u201d* is logically **different** from the inference we just derived.\n\nTo see why the premises do **not** force the existence of an addictive thing that is **not** a cigarette, construct a model that satisfies both premises but makes the conclusion false.\n\n| Element | \\(A\\) (Addictive) | \\(I\\) (Inexpensive) | \\(C\\) (Cigarette) |\n|---------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| \\(a\\)   | **True**          | **False**           | **True**          |\n| \\(b\\)   | **False**         | **True**            | **True**          |\n| \\(c\\)   | **False**         | **False**           | **False**         |\n\n*Check the premises*\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1** \u2013 For every \\(x\\), if \\(A(x)\\) then \\(\\neg I(x)\\).  \n   Only \\(a\\) is addictive, and \\(I(a)=\\text{False}\\). \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. **Premise\u202f2** \u2013 There is some \\(x\\) that is both \\(C\\) and \\(I\\).  \n   \\(b\\) satisfies \\(C(b)=\\text{True}\\) and \\(I(b)=\\text{True}\\). \u2714\ufe0f\n\n*Check the conclusion*\n\n- There should be an \\(x\\) such that \\(A(x)\\land\\neg C(x)\\).  \n  No such element exists: the only addictive element \\(a\\) is a cigarette.\n\nThus, the premises are satisfied while the conclusion is false.

Intuitive summary\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1** tells us addictive items are never inexpensive.  \n2. **Premise\u202f2** tells us some cigarettes are inexpensive \u2013 therefore those particular cigarettes *cannot* be addictive.  \n3.

What the premises actually give us\n\n1. **Existence of a cheap cigarette that is *not* addictive**\n\n   From Premise\u202f1 we know there is at least one cigarette that is inexpensive.  \n   Premise\u202f2 tells us that *no* addictive thing can be inexpensive.  \n   Therefore that particular inexpensive cigarette *cannot* be addictive.\n\n   Symbolically:\n   ```\n   \u2203x (C(x) \u2227 I(x))   &\n   \u2200x (A(x) \u2192 \u00acI(x))\n   ------------------------------------\n   \u2192 \u2203x (C(x) \u2227 I(x) \u2227 \u00acA(x))\n   ```\n\n   In words: *there exists a cigarette that is inexpensive and not addictive*.\n\n2. **No restriction on what *all* addictive things might be**\n\n   The premises give **no** information that forces any addictive thing to be *not* a cigarette.  \n   They also do not rule out the possibility that every addictive thing **is** a cigarette.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  The logical gap to the conclusion\n\nThe conclusion we want is:\n\n> \u2203x (A(x) \u2227 \u00acC(x))  \n\ni.e., \u201cthere exists an addictive thing that is not a cigarette\u201d.\n\nFrom the premises we can only deduce that:\n\n> \u2203x (C(x) \u2227 \u00acA(x))  \n\ni.e., \u201cthere exists a cigarette that is not addictive\u201d.\n\nThe two existential statements are logically independent; knowing that a cheap cigarette is non\u2011addictive says nothing about the existence of an addictive thing that is not a cigarette.  \n\nHence the inference \u201csome addictive things are not cigarettes\u201d **does not logically follow** from the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Logical form summary\n\nThe syllogism has the following structural form:\n\n```\nSome M are P      (\u2203x (M(x) \u2227 P(x)))          \u2013 Premise 1\nNo M are Q        (\u2200x (M(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)))          \u2013 Premise 2\n------------------------------\nSome M are not R   (\u2203x (M(x) \u2227 \u00acR(x)))         \u2013 Conclusion\n```\n\nHere the \u201cmiddle term\u201d **M** (the property \u201cinexpensive\u201d) appears in the two premises but **never appears in the conclusion**, which is a classic signal that the inference is invalid (in traditional categorical logic the conclusion would need to involve the middle term in order for the syllogism to be legitimate).\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Final verdict\n\nBecause the conclusion is *not* a logical consequence of the premises, the syllogism is **incorrect** (invalid). The premises do not entail that there exists an addictive thing which is *not* a cigarette; the only thing they force is the existence of a cigarette that is not addictive.",

Look for a model that satisfies the premises but not the conclusion  \n\nA *model* is a world in which all premises are true. If we can find a model in which at least one premise is false, the syllogism would still be valid \u2013 but we look for a *counter\u2011example* that shows invalidity.\n\n**Construct a counter\u2011example:**\n\n1. **Domain**: Let the domain contain two elements:  \n   - \\(d_1\\) \u2013 a cigarette that is inexpensive.  \n   - \\(d_2\\) \u2013 a non\u2011cigarette that is not inexpensive and not addictive.\n\n2. **Interpret the predicates**:  \n   - \\(C(d_1)\\) is true, all other \\(C\\) are false.  \n   - \\(I(d_1)\\) is true, all other \\(I\\) are false.  \n   - \\(A(x)\\) is false for every \\(x\\) (there are no addictive things at all).\n\nNow check the premises:\n\n| Premise | Evaluation |\n|---------|------------|\n| \\(\\exists x (C(x)\\land I(x))\\) | true (holds for \\(d_1\\)) |\n| \\(\\forall x (A(x)\\rightarrow \\lnot I(x))\\) | true, vacuously, because no \\(x\\) satisfies \\(A(x)\\) |\n\nSo **both premises are true** in this model.\n\nCheck the conclusion:\n\n| Conclusion | Evaluation |\n|------------|------------|\n| \\(\\exists x (A(x)\\land \\lnot C(x))\\) | false, because there is **no** \\(x\\) with \\(A(x)\\) true (no addictive things exist).\n\nSince we found a model where the premises hold but the conclusion does **not** hold, the inference is **invalid**.\n\n### 3. What the premises actually allow\n\n- Premise 1 tells us that at least one cigarette is inexpensive.  \n- Premise 2 tells us that *any* thing that is inexpensive can\u2019t be addictive (so inexpensive things are non\u2011addictive).  \n- But nothing tells us whether **any** addictive thing exists, or whether it could be a cigarette or not.  \n\nBecause of this lack of information, we cannot logically conclude that \u201csome addictive thing is not a cigarette\u201d. The conclusion would require an **existential claim** about addictive things that is not supported by the premises.\n\n### 4. Classic categorical logic check\n\nIn traditional categorical logic, the form of the syllogism is:\n\n1. **Some C are I** (particular affirmative).  \n2. **No A are I** (universal negative).  \n3. **Therefore, Some A are not C** (particular negative).\n\nUsing the standard *moods* and *figures*, this syllogism does not match any valid form (e.g., it violates the *middle term* requirement or has no form that allows that particular negative conclusion). Hence it is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBecause the premises do not entail the conclusion (as demonstrated by the counter\u2011example and the logical analysis), the syllogism is **incorrect / invalid**.",

Logical form in categorical syllogism terms\n\n- **Premise\u202f1** is an **E\u2011type** proposition: \u201cNo\u202fS\u202fare\u202fM\u201d (here *M* = \u201ccheaply\u201d).\n- **Premise\u202f2** is an **I\u2011type** proposition: \u201cSome\u202fP\u202fare\u202fM\u201d (subject\u202fP = \u201cpuffles\u201d).\n\nThe conclusion is an **O\u2011type** proposition: \u201cSome\u202fS\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fP\u201d (i.e., \u201cSome\u202fS\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fP\u201d).\n\nThus the syllogism has the shape:\n\n> **E** (No\u202fS\u202fare\u202fM) <br>  \n> **I** (Some\u202fP\u202fare\u202fM) <br>  \n> **O** (Some\u202fS\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fP)\n\nwhere the *middle term* (M) is \u201ccheaply\u201d.\n\n### 2. Checking validity via Venn diagrams\n\nCreate a Venn diagram with three circles: **S**, **P**, and **M**.\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1** \u2013 \u201cNo\u202fS\u202fare\u202fM\u201d  \n   - Completely shade the S\u2229M area. There can be no overlap between **S** and **M**.\n\n2. **Premise\u202f2** \u2013 \u201cSome\u202fP\u202fare\u202fM\u201d  \n   - Place a single unshaded dot in the P\u2229M intersection.  \n   - This means there is at least one element that belongs to both **P** and **M**.\n\n3. **Conclusion** \u2013 \u201cSome\u202fS\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fP\u201d  \n   - Requires an unshaded dot in the S\u2229\u00acP region (i.e., in the part of S that does **not** overlap with P).\n\n**Can we guarantee such a dot?**\n\nNo.  \n- The two premises do **not** restrict how **S** and **P** overlap.  \n- It is entirely possible that:\n  - **S** is empty (no snibble things exist).  \n  - Or all elements that are **S** also belong to **P** (every snibble thing happens to be a puffle).  \n  - Both possibilities satisfy Premise\u202f1 and Premise\u202f2.  \n- In both cases, the conclusion \u201cSome\u202fS are not\u202fP\u201d would be false.\n\nHence the conclusion does **not** logically follow from the premises.\n\n### 3. Heuristic rule check\n\nIn traditional categorical logic, an E\u2011I\u2011O syllogism is **unimpossible** because the conclusion O (negative statement about existence) is *not* derivable from a negative universal (E) and an existential affirmative (I). The only valid forms that end with an O conclusion are those where the middle term is present in both premises in a certain way (e.g., Darii, Cesare). Here the middle term \u201ccheaply\u201d is only on the right side of Premise\u202f2, so no valid rule yields the required conclusion.\n\n### 4. Summary of the logical shortcoming\n\n- Premise\u202f1 tells us *what* snibble things are not (they\u2019re not cheap).\n- Premise\u202f2 tells us *something* about puffles (there\u2019s a cheap puffle).\n- **Nothing** in either premise links the \u201csnibble thing\u201d class to the \u201cpuffle\u201d class except the indirect fact that *both classes might intersect the cheap set in different ways*.\n\nBecause there is **no guarantee** that any snibble thing exists **outside** the puffle class, the conclusion is not forced by the premises.\n\n---\n\n## Final verdict\n\n**The syllogism is incorrect (invalid).** The premises do not suffice to deduce that some snibble things are not puffles. The conclusion is logically independent of the given premises.",

What do the premises guarantee?\n\n* Premise\u202f1 tells us that **any** object that is *cheap* cannot be a *snibble*. So the sets \\(S\\) and \\(C\\) are disjoint.\n* Premise\u202f2 asserts that at least one *puffle* is *cheap*. Thus, we know there exists an object \\(p\\) that is both a *puffle* and *cheap* (i.e., \\(p \\in P \\cap C\\)).\n\nFrom these two premises we can deduce that the *cheap puffles* are **not** snibbles, but we learn *nothing* about the existence or non\u2011existance of snibble things.\n\n#### 2.  Does the conclusion follow?\n\nThe conclusion says **there is a snibble that is not a puffle** (`\u2203x (S(x) \u2227 \u00acP(x))`).  \nTo establish this we would need two things:\n\n1. **Existence of at least one snibble** (`\u2203x S(x)`).\n2. That that snibble is **not** a puffle (`\u2203x (S(x) \u2227 \u00acP(x))`).\n\nPremises **1** and **2** give us no guarantee that any snibble exists at all. They merely state: \n- *Anything that is cheap is not a snibble,* and \n- *There is something that is both puff and cheap.*\n\nA model that satisfies the premises but **has no snibble** will make the premises true yet make the conclusion false. For example:\n\n| Domain | S (snibble) | P (puffle) | C (cheap) |\n|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|\n| {p1}   | \u2205           | {p1}       | {p1}      |\n\n- Premise\u202f1: `S \u2229 C = \u2205` (trivially true; there are no snibbles).  \n- Premise\u202f2: `\u2203x (P(x) \u2227 C(x))` is true because p1 is both a puffle and cheap.  \n- Conclusion: `\u2203x (S(x) \u2227 \u00acP(x))` is **false** because there is no snibble at all.\n\nSince we found a case where the premises are both true and the conclusion is false, the syllogism is **invalid**.\n\n#### 3.  Syllogistic mood & figure\n\nThe syllogism has the mood **E\u2011I\u2011O** with an undisclosed figure.  \nStandard legitimate moods (e.g., AAA, EAE, etc.) do not include E\u2011I\u2011O in this figure, reflecting its invalidity.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe premises do **not** logically entail the conclusion.

Identify the middle term\n\nThe **middle term** is the one that occurs in *both* premises but **not** in the conclusion.  \nHere, *M* (\u201ccheaply\u201d) is the middle term.\n\n*Premise 1:* \u201cSome P are M\u201d \u2013 *M* is predicate.  \n*Premise 2:* \u201cNo S are M\u201d \u2013 *M* is predicate.\n\nThe middle term appears as a **predicate in both premises**.  \nThat is permitted in Aristotelian logic, but it does not by itself guarantee validity.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Check the basic validity conditions\n\nFor a categorical syllogism to be valid we need:\n\n1. **All terms appear** in the premises (captured: P, S, M are all used).  \n2. **The middle term appears exactly once** in each premise (\u2713).  \n3. **The conclusion fits the normal form**: it must use P and S as subject and predicate in some order (\u2713).  \n4. **No existential fallacies**: If the conclusion asserts the *existence* of a term, the premises must also assert that existence.\n\nV.\u202fPoint\u202f4 is where this argument fails.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Existential Fallacy (Illicit Minor)\n\nThe conclusion is an **O\u2011statement** (\u201cSome *S* are not *P*\u201d), which expresses that *some snibble things exist*.\n\nThe premises, however, say nothing about the existence of *snibbles*:\n\n* \u201cNo *S* are *M*\u201d says nothing about whether *S* exist (it is vacuously true if *S* are empty).  \n* \u201cSome *P* are *M*\u201d gives existence of a *puffle*, but not of a *snibble*.\n\nBecause the premises do **not** guarantee that *snibble things* exist, the conclusion\u2019s existential claim is not logically forced.  \n\nA classic counter\u2011example is:\n\n| World | Interpretation |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **W1** | 1 puffle exists, and it is cheap. No snibbles exist. |\n| **Premises** | \u201cSome puffles are cheap\u201d \u2192 true (the puffle is cheap).<br>\u201cNo snibbles are cheap\u201d \u2192 true vacuously (there are none). |\n| **Conclusion** | \u201cSome snibbles are not puffles\u201d \u2192 **false** (there are no snibbles, so the existential quantifier fails). |\n\nSince we can construct a model where both premises are true but the conclusion false, **the syllogism is invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Formal Mis\u2011alignment (Optional for full rigor)\n\nIf we try to match the argument to a standard Aristotelian mood:\n\n| Premise  | Form | Figure (middle term positions) |\n|----------|------|--------------------------------|\n| 1 (minor) | I (Some P are M) | Figure 2: middle term as predicate of minor premise |\n| 2 (major) | E (No S are M)\u00a0| Figure 2: middle term as predicate of major premise |\n\nThe conclusion would thus be an **O\u2011statement** in **Figure 2**.  \nThe only valid O\u2011conclusion form in Figure\u202f2 is **OIE** (major E, minor I \u2192 conclusion O), but this syllogism is **EIO** (major E, minor I, conclusion O).  \nTherefore, even from a mood\u2011figure perspective it is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 6.  Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do not ensure the existence of snibble things, the conclusion \u201cSome snibble things are not puffles\u201d is not a logical consequence.

What the syllogism claims\n\nTo be valid, from the two premises it must be *necessary* that there exists at least one object that is:\n- an S (a snibble thing), and  \n- not a P (not a puffle).\n\nThe premises only give us information about the **relation between the sets** \u201cP\u201d and \u201cC\u201d (\u2203\u2011P\u2227C) and between \u201cS\u201d and \u201cC\u201d (\u2200\u2011S \u2192 \u00acC).  \nNothing in the premises asserts the existence of an **S** at all.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The missing existential commitment\n\nThe universal negative **E** (\u201cNo\u202fS\u202fare\u202fC\u201d) is *vacuously* true whenever the set of S\u2019s is empty.  \nTherefore the second premise does **not** guarantee that any snibble thing exists.\n\nConsequently, the conclusion, which explicitly requires the existence of some S, cannot be deduced.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Quick check in \u201cclassical\u201d syllogistic terms\n\nThe moods of the premises and conclusion are I,\u202fE,\u202fO.  \nNo standard figure of Aristotelian syllogistic (1\u20134) allows the sequence I \u2192 E \u2192 O, and the structure fails the **Existential Import** test (the second premise does not import an existential). Thus the argument is invalid in both the traditional and the modern (truth\u2011functional) formulations.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Explicit counter\u2011example (a model in which premises are true but conclusion false)\n\nDefine a universe with two individuals:  \n\n| Individual | P (puffles) | S (snibble) | C (cheap) |\n|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| \\(a\\)      | **Yes**     | **No**      | **Yes**   |\n| \\(b\\)      | **Yes**     | **Yes**     | **No**    |\n\nInterpretation:\n\n* \\(a\\) is a puffle that is cheap.  \n* \\(b\\) is both a puffle and a snibble, and it is **not** cheap.  \n\nNow check the premises:\n\n1. **Some puffles are cheap** \u2013 satisfied by \\(a\\).  \n2. **No snibble things are cheap** \u2013 satisfied because \\(b\\) is a snibble and not cheap; there is no snibble that is cheap.\n\nCheck the conclusion:\n\n* **Some snibble things are not puffles** \u2013 would require a snibble that is not a puffle.  \n  In this structure, the only snibble \\(b\\) *is* a puffle.  \n  Therefore the conclusion is **false**.\n\nThus we have a *true* set of premises and a *false* conclusion \u2192 the syllogism is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Summary\n\n* The argument\u2019s categorical form is **IEO** in Figure\u202f3, which is not one of the legitimate valid moods.  \n* A direct counter\u2011model shows the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.  \n\nHence **the syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**",

Why the form is not a standard valid pattern\n\nA valid categorical syllogism must use the *middle term* to connect the two premises. In standard moods (e.g., AAA, EAE, etc.), the middle term appears in both premises and is omitted in the conclusion. Here the middle term would be the class \u201csweet things,\u201d but it appears in the first premise and *only negatively* in the second premise, so it cannot provide the necessary link between \u201cliquors\u201d and \u201cdrinks.\u201d  \nThus no standard syllogistic mood (AAI, EAE, AII, etc.) matches this form.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBecause we can construct a concrete counter\u2011model and because the argument does not conform to any of the valid categorical moods, the syllogism\n\n> *Premise 1:* Some liquors are sweet things.  \n> *Premise 2:* No drinks are sweet things.  \n> *Conclusion:* Therefore, some drinks are not liquors.\n\nis **incorrect** (invalid).",

Examine logical consequence** | From (1) we know there is an element that is both a liquor and a sweet thing. From (2) we know **no** drink can be a sweet thing. Hence that particular sweet liquor cannot be a drink. Thus we can infer: **\u2203x (L(x) \u2227 \u00acD(x))** \u2013 *Some liquors are not drinks.* | This is a valid inference, but it is **not** the conclusion given. |\n| **5. Check if the required conclusion follows** | Do the premises force the existence of an element that is a drink but not a liquor? | **No.** The premises impose no restriction on the relationship between *drinks* and *liquors* beyond the fact that **any** drink cannot be a sweet thing.

Check for categorical validity\n\nA categorical syllogism is valid only if it corresponds to one of the 19 classic moods available in the 3 possible figures.  \nThe mood\u2011figure combinations that are valid in classical logic are listed in the standard tables.  \n**EIO** is *not* one of the 19 valid combinations in any figure\u2014none of the valid forms contain an I (some \u2026) premise, an E (no \u2026) premise, and an O (some \u2026 not \u2026) conclusion.\n\nTherefore, even before looking at the figures, the mood itself is already invalid.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Valid forms for Figure\u202f3\n\nThe classical list of **valid** moods for Figure\u202f3 (R\u00e9nyi's tables) is very short:\n\n| Valid figure\u202f3 moods |\n|----------------------|\n| A\u202fA\u202fI (Darii) |\n| O\u202fA\u202fO (Ferio) |\n| O\u202fO\u202fO (Elli) \u2013 *if one of the premises is an O* |\n\nThere is **no** valid mood of the type **E\u202fI\u202fO** in Figure\u202f3.  \nHence the syllogism fails the last requirement: its **mood\u2011figure pair** is not among the valid templates.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Illustrate the failure with a concrete counter\u2011example\n\nLet us instantiate the terms:\n\n| Object | \u201cSlurple\u201d? | \u201cSuggle thing\u201d? | \u201cBrimble\u201d? |\n|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| \\(a\\) | yes | **no** | **yes** |\n| \\(b\\) | yes | **no** | no |\n| \\(c\\) | no  | yes | yes |\n| \\(d\\) | no  | yes | no |\n\n- **Premise\u202f1 (\u201cNo slurples are suggle things\u201d)**  \n  Truth: \u2713 All slurples (\\(a,b\\)) are not suggle.\n\n- **Premise\u202f2 (\u201cSome brimbles are suggle things\u201d)**  \n  Truth: \u2713 Brimbles \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) include \\(c\\), a suggle thing.\n\n- **Conclusion (\u201cSome slurples are not brimbles\u201d)**  \n  Truth: Usually **true** (e.g., \\(b\\) satisfies it), but the conclusion can be **false** if we instead let\n\n| Object | Slurple | Suggle thing | Brimble |\n|--------|---------|--------------|---------|\n| \\(x\\) | yes | **no** | no |\n| \\(y\\) | yes | **no** | yes |\n\nNow  \n\n- Premise\u202f1: \u2713 (both slurples are not suggle)  \n- Premise\u202f2: \u2713 (brimble \\(y\\) is not a suggle; *but we can choose a different arrangement where a brimble is a suggle to keep Premise\u202f2 true*  \n  \u2013 for instance, add another object \\(z\\) that is both a brimble and a suggle, so Premise\u202f2 remains true)  \n\nBut we set **no slurple is a brimble** (all slurples set as \u00acbrimble). Then the conclusion \u201cSome slurples are not brimbles\u201d would still be **true**, so this example doesn't refute. To refute, we need a case where the premises hold **and** the conclusion fails.\n\nTake:\n\n| Object | Slurple | Suggle thing | Brimble |\n|--------|---------|--------------|---------|\n| \\(p\\) | **yes** | **no**     | **yes** |\n| \\(q\\) | **yes** | **no**     | **yes** |\n| \\(r\\) | **no** | **yes**     | **yes** |\n\nPremises:  \n- No slurples are suggle (\u2713)  \n- Some brimbles are suggle (\u2713, because \\(r\\) is a brimble and a suggle)  \n\nConclusion:  \n- Some slurples are not brimbles \u2192 **false** because all slurples (\\(p,q\\)) *are* brimbles.  \n\nThus, with these truth\u2011table configurations, the premises can be true while the conclusion is false, confirming the **invalidity** of the form.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Bottom line\n\nThe syllogism:\n\n1. No slurples are suggle things.  \n2. Some brimbles are suggle things.  \n**Therefore, some slurples are not brimbles.**\n\nis **invalid** (incorrect). The mood **E\u202fI\u202fO** in Figure\u202f3 is not a recognized valid pattern of categorical syllogisms, and a counter\u2011example exists where the premises are true and the conclusion false.",

Do the premises guarantee the existence of a slurple?\n\nThe premises talk about *suggle things* and *brimbles*, but they make **no assertion** that at least one slurple exists.  \n- \u201cNo slurples are suggle things\u201d is logically true whether or not any slurples exist.  \n- Hence the existence of a slurple is **not** forced by the premises.\n\nIf there is no slurple at all, the proposition *Some slurples are not brimbles* is false (you cannot assert the existence of something that doesn't exist).\n\n### 2. Assuming a slurple exists, can we still conclude it is not a brimble?\n\nEven **if** we know at least one slurple exists, the premises give **no restriction** on how slurples and brimbles may overlap.  \nSpecifically:\n\n- Premise\u202f2 tells us only that a slurple cannot be a *suggle thing*.\n- Premise\u202f1 tells us only that some brimbles **are** *suggle things*.\n\nThere is nothing to prevent **all** slurples from being brimbles. For example:\n\n| Object | Brimble? | Suggle? | Slurple? |\n|--------|----------|---------|----------|\n| `x`    | Yes      | Yes     | No       |\n| `y`    | Yes      | No      | Yes      |\n\n- Premise\u202f1 holds (`x` is both a brimble and a suggle).\n- Premise\u202f2 holds (`y` is a slurple but not a suggle).\n- Conclusion fails: the only slurple (`y`) **is** a brimble.\n\nThus the premises are consistent with a situation where the conclusion is false.\n\n### 3.

The standard forms (Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Darapti, etc.) all require a common categorical link between the major and minor terms, which is missing here.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do **not** guarantee the existence of a slurple, and even if a slurple existed they could still be brimbles, the conclusion \u201cSome slurples are not brimbles\u201d is **not logically entailed**.

Compare with the conclusion\n\n**Conclusion** \u2013 *Some fish are not trout*  \n\\[\n\\exists x\\;(x\\in F \\land x\\notin T)\n\\]\n\nThis is a **different existence claim** \u2013 it asserts that at least one object exists that belongs to the set of fish but not to the set of trout.\n\nOur deduction from the premises brought us to the existence of a trout *not* belonging to the set of fish; it gave **no claim about the existence of any fish**.  Without an assertion that \u201cthere is at least one fish\u201d we cannot conclude that \u201cthere is some fish that is not a trout.\u201d  The predicates have been swapped: \n\n- Premises \u2192 *exists a T\u2227\u00acF*  \n- Conclusion \u2192 *exists an F\u2227\u00acT*  \n\nThe two statements are not logically equivalent, and no inference rule of categorical logic transforms one into the other.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Check for hidden assumptions\n\nOne might be tempted to add **a hidden premise** that *trout are fish* (i.e., \\(T\\subseteq F\\)).  If that premise were present, the premises would become contradictory:\n\n- There would be a trout that is colourful (Premise\u202f1).  \n- Since trout are fish, that trout would also be a fish.  \n- Yet Premise\u202f2 states that no fish are colourful.\n\nThus the premises together would be **inconsistent**\u2014but that does *not* help to prove the conclusion; instead, it shows the premises cannot all hold simultaneously.  The syllogism is therefore either *invalid* (does not entail the conclusion) or *inconsistent* (does not all hold).\n\nSince our analysis shows that even *without* the hidden \u201ctrout \u2286 fish\u201d assumption the conclusion cannot be derived, the syllogism is **not valid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Final verdict\n\nThe syllogism does **not** correctly deduce \u201csome fish are not trout\u201d from its premises.  Consequently, **the syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**",

Why the formal logic confirms the flaw\n\nIn standard categorical syllogisms, an **E\u2013I \u2192 O** conclusion is only legitimate in certain figures.  \nHere the syllogism matches *Figure\u202f1* (E\u2013I\u2013O) **only if** the middle term is the predicate of the major premise and the subject of the minor premise.  \nOur structure is\n\n```\nNo S are M       (E)\nSome P are M     (I)\n-----------\nSome S are not P (O)\n```\n\nThis arrangement corresponds to **EII-1**?

The middle term **m** is \u201cstrong\u201d (it occurs in the premises as the subject of a **some\u2013** statement and as the predicate of a **no\u2013** statement).

In our example the link is missing, so the inference collapses.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nBecause we can produce a counterexample where the premises are true and the conclusion false, the syllogism is **incorrect**.

Attempt to derive the conclusion\n\nTo derive  \\(\\exists x\\bigl(R(x)\\land \\lnot P(x)\\bigr)\\) we would need either:\n\n1. **An existence claim about flatbles**, or  \n2. **A link between being a flatble and *not* being a piece of furnbles**.\n\nThe premises provide **neither** of these:\n\n* Premise\u202f1 talks about pieces of furnbles and prettles, but makes no mention of flatbles at all.  \n* Premise\u202f2 only relates flatbles to prettles; it does NOT claim that flatbles are (or are not) pieces of furnbles.\n\nThus the logical deduction cannot go forward.

What would be required for a valid syllogism?\n\nIn classical categorical logic validity requires that:\n\n1. The middle term (here *prettles*) is distributed in at least one premise.  \n2. No term is distributed in the conclusion unless it was distributed in a premise.  \n3. The figure (order of terms) and mood (the pattern of propositions) must satisfy one of the 4 valid moods per figure.\n\nBecause none of these conditions are met here, the argument fails the validity test.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Consequently, the conclusion is *not* a logical consequence of the premises\u2014it is *conditionally* true but not *necessarily* true.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Classical categorical logic check\n\nIn traditional categorical syllogisms:\n\n- **Existential import** matters for \"some\" premises and conclusions.  \n  - \u201cSome soundles are sparkle\u201d asserts the existence of **at least one** Soundle.  \n  - \u201cNo stringles are sparkle\u201d does **not** assert the existence of any Stringle.  \n  - The conclusion \u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d asserts the existence of **at least one** Stringle.\n\nBecause Premise\u202f2 does **not** guarantee that any Stringles exist, the existence of a Stringle required by the conclusion is *unsubstantiated*. Therefore the syllogism violates the *existential import* requirement for a valid categorical syllogism.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Counter\u2011example model\n\nCreate a tiny domain of 3 entities:\n\n| Entity | Soundle | Stringle | Sparkle |\n|--------|----------|----------|---------|\n| **a**  | Yes      | No       | Yes     |\n| **b**  | Yes      | Yes      | No      |\n| **c**  | No       | No       | No      |\n\n- **Premise\u202f1**: \u201cSome soundles are sparkle\u201d \u2013 satisfied by entity **a** (Soundle & Sparkle).\n- **Premise\u202f2**: \u201cNo stringles are sparkle\u201d \u2013 satisfied because entity **b** is a Stringle but not a Sparkle; entity **c** is neither.\n- **Conclusion**: \u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d \u2013 **fails** because entity **b** is a Stringle **and** a Soundle; there is no Stringle that is *not* a Soundle.\n\nThus the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.\n\n---\n\n### 6.

What the conclusion demands\nThe conclusion asserts that **there exists an entity that is a decidle but not a smartle**.\n\n### 3. Is the conclusion forced by the premises?\n\nNo.  \n- **Scenario\u202fA (trivial counter\u2011model)**  \n  Let the domain consist of a single person *a* who is **both** a smartle and a decidle, and who is also a fairble.\n\n  ```\n  Smartles(a) = true\n  Decidles(a) = true\n  Fairble(a) = true\n  ```\n\n  Check the premises:\n  - \u2203x (Smartles(x) \u2227 Fairble(x)) \u2192 true (a)\n  - \u2203y (Decidles(y) \u2227 Fairble(y)) \u2192 true (a)\n\n  But the conclusion:\n  - \u2203z (Decidles(z) \u2227 \u00acSmartles(z)) \u2192 false, because z can only be a, and a is a smartle.\n\n  Thus the premises are true while the conclusion is false.\n\n- **Scenario\u202fB (illustration of a different arrangement)**  \n  Suppose there are two fairbles, *a* and *b*.  \n  - *a* is a smartle\u202f\u2227\u202ffairble.  \n  - *b* is a decidle\u202f\u2227\u202ffairble.  \n  Again, the premises hold, but we can still put *a* = *b* (they are the same entity) or keep them distinct; in either case, nothing in the premises forces the existence of a decidle that is *not* a smartle.\n\nBecause we can construct a model where the premises are true and the conclusion false, the syllogism is **not logically valid**.\n\n---\n\n## Why it fails in categorical terms\n\nThe syllogistic pattern is:\n\n```\nSome A are M.

Valid syllogisms with two existential premises can only lead to *universal* conclusions (e.g., \u201cAll P are A\u201d) or to another existential conclusion that does not introduce a negation on the minor term.\n\n---\n\n### Quick takeaway\n\n- Premises 1 & 2 only guarantee that *some* smartles and *some* decidles are fairbles.  \n- They do **not** guarantee that the set of decidles is disjoint from the set of smartles.  \n- Therefore, the conclusion \u201csome decidles are not smartles\u201d is **not logically entailed**.\n\n**Result:** The syllogism is **incorrect** (invalid).",

Therefore the syllogism is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Intuitive explanation\n\nThe two premises only tell us that *there exists* at least one fairble that is a smartle and at least one fairble that is a decidle.  \nThey do **not** prohibit the two fairbles from being the **same** individual, or from all decidles that are fairble also being smartles.  \n\nIf it were the case that **every** decidle that is fairble is also a smartle, then the conclusion \u201csome decidle is not a smartle\u201d would fail.  \nThus we have no logical guarantee that such a non\u2011smartle decidle exists.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe syllogism\n\n> **Premise 1:** Some smartles are fairble.  \n> **Premise 2:** Some decidles are fairble.  \n> **Conclusion:** Therefore, some decidles are not smartles.\n\nis **incorrect** (invalid).

Why the structure is invalid\n\nA categorical syllogism is valid only if:\n\n1. Both premises **distribute** the middle term (the term that appears in both premises).\n2. The conclusion follows the rules of distribution that the premises establish.\n3. The figure (the positions of the terms) is one of the six valid figures, and the mood (the pattern I/E/O) is one of the valid moods for that figure.\n\nHere the middle term is **L** (living things).  \n- In premise\u202f1 (`Some P are L`) the predicate (`L`) is **not** distributed.  \n- In premise\u202f2 (`No G are L`) the predicate (`L`) **is** distributed.\n\nBecause the middle term is **undistributed in one premise**, the illicit \u201cundistributed middle\u201d fallacy occurs. Consequently, we cannot draw any logical relation between the two other terms (`P` and `G`) solely from the premises.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Counter\u2011model (showing the conclusion can be false)\n\nWe can construct a model in which both premises are true but the conclusion is false.\n\n| Element | Is plant? | Is grass? | Is living? |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| `A` | *yes* | no | *yes* |\n| `B` | *yes* | no | no |\n| `C` | *yes* | *yes* | no |\n\n- **Premise\u202f1**: `Some plants are living` \u2014 element `A` satisfies this.  \n- **Premise\u202f2**: `No grasses are living` \u2014 neither `C` is living (true).  \n- **Conclusion**: `Some grasses are not plants` \u2014 **false**, because the only grass (`C`) *is* a plant.\n\nSince the premises are satisfied but the conclusion is not, the syllogism is **logically invalid**.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Bottom line\n\n- The premises do **not** logically entail the conclusion.  \n- The categorical argument violates the rule of the **undistributed middle**.  \n- A counter\u2011model shows the premises can hold while the conclusion fails.\n\n**Therefore, the syllogism is incorrect (invalid).**",

Categorical\u2011logic perspective\n\nIn terms of the traditional figure of categorical syllogisms:\n\n| Premise | Figure | Form |\n|---------|--------|------|\n| Some plants are living things | I \u2192 A | **Some\u202fA\u202fare\u202fB** |\n| No grasses are living things | N \u2192 A | **No\u202fC\u202fare\u202fB** |\n| Conclusion | ? | **Some\u202fC\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fA** |\n\nA syllogism of the form:\n\n> Some\u202fA\u202fare\u202fB.  \n> No\u202fC\u202fare\u202fB.  \n> \u201cTherefore, some\u202fC\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fA.\u201d\n\nis *invalid*.

The middle term \\(B\\) (in this case, \u201cliving things\u201d) can be shared by a tiny subset of\u202fA\u202fand may be entirely disjoint from\u202fC.\n\nThus, across both formal logic and traditional categorical logic, the syllogism fails to be valid.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

The standard valid combinations for Figure\u202f4 are:\n\n- **EIO** **(only if the middle term is a superordinate of the minor term)** \u2013 but that requires *S* to be a *subset* of *M*, which is not the case here.\n- The only universally accepted valid mnemonic for Figure\u202f4 is **EIO** **only when** the middle term *is* the predicate in both premises *and* it is the **major** term in the conclusion (**major premise is E, minor premise is I**). That specific arrangement is:\n\n  1. **No\u202fS are\u202fM**  \n  2. **Some\u202fM are\u202fP**  \n  3. **Some\u202fS are not\u202fP**\n\n  This matches the pattern **EIO** *with M as the major term*\u2014the middle term is the **predicate of the conclusion** (i.e. the major term).

The conclusion does **not contain \u201cweddle\u201d at all**, so it is *not distributed* and, in fact, *not even present*.  \n3. **Rule:** *A term that is distributed in a premise cannot be undistributed in the conclusion.*  \n   - Consequently, the syllogism violates this rule.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

The existence (or non\u2011existence) of a \u201cgood\u2011swimmer vegetarian\u201d says nothing about the swimming ability of any deep\u2011sea diver.\n\nTo illustrate the failure, consider a counter\u2011model:\n\n| Person | Deep\u2011sea diver (D) | Good swimmer (G) | Vegetarian (V) |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| **a** | No | Yes | Yes |\n| **b** | Yes | Yes | No |\n\n*Premises satisfied*  \n- \\(a\\) is a good swimmer and vegetarian \u2192 \u201cSome G are V.\u201d  \n- No one is both a deep\u2011sea diver and a vegetarian \u2192 \u201cNo D are V.\u201d  \n\n*Conclusion violated*  \n- Every deep\u2011sea diver (only \\(b\\)) is a good swimmer, so \u201cSome D are not G\u201d is false.\n\nTherefore the conclusion is not logically forced by the premises; the syllogism is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### Formal classification\n\nUsing the standard mood\u2013figure notation:\n\n- **Premise\u202f1** is an E proposition (universal negative): **D\u202fE\u202fV**.  \n- **Premise\u202f2** is an I proposition (particular affirmative): **G\u202fI\u202fV**.  \n- **Conclusion** is an O proposition (particular negative): **D\u202fO\u202fG**.\n\nThis is the mood **EIO** in figure\u202f2.

Identify terms\n\n| Term | Position in the conclusion |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Major term** (predicated in the conclusion) | \u00acS (predicate: *not swimbles*) |\n| **Minor term** (subject in the conclusion) | D (subject: *deeples*) |\n| **Middle term** | P (predicate in both premises) |\n\nSo the **middle term** appears only as a predicate, never as a subject.\n\n### 3. Figure\n\nIn traditional categorical syllogism theory a figure is determined by the positions of the middle term:\n\n| Figure | Middle term in Premise\u202f1 | Middle term in Premise\u202f2 |\n|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1 | Subject | Predicate |\n| 2 | Predicate | Subject |\n| **3** | Subject | Subject |\n| 4 | Predicate | Predicate |\n\nOur syllogism is **Figure\u202f4** (middle term is predicate in *both* premises).  \nFigure\u202f4 is **not a valid figure**\u2014there is no way to transit a property when the middle term never functions as a subject.\n\n### 4. Logical consequences\n\nFrom the premises we know:\n\n- No object can be both a deeple **and** a plantle.  \n- Some objects exist that are both swimbles **and** plantles.\n\nBut these facts give us **no information** about the relation between deeples and swimbles:\n\n- We do not know whether any deeple exists at all.  \n- Even if a deeple existed, we have no data stating whether it is or is not a swimble.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that *some* deeple is not a swimble. In fact:\n\n- If there are **no** deeples, the conclusion *\u201csome deeples are not swimbles\u201d* is simply false.  \n- If every deeple were a swimble, the conclusion would be false as well.\n\n### 5. Existential import\n\nTraditional categorical logic sometimes assumes that universal statements (like \u201cNo deeples are plantles\u201d) imply the existence of at least one deeple. Modern treatments of syllogisms **do not** make that assumption. Either way, nothing in the premises guarantees the existence of a deeple, so an existential conclusion cannot be justified.\n\n### 6. Verdict\n\nThe syllogism is **incorrect**, i.e., **invalid**.\n\n**Why?**  \nBecause the middle term never functions as a subject, the two premises provide no bridge that links the minor term (deeples) to the major term (swimbles). Additionally, no premise asserts the existence of a deeple, so the existential claim in the conclusion cannot be established.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The syllogism *\u201cNo deeples are plantles. Some swimbles are plantles. Therefore, some deeples are not swimbles.\u201d* is **invalid (incorrect)**.",

Existential import of the conclusion\n\n\u201cSome deeples are not swimbles\u201d asserts the **existence** of at least one *deeple*.  \nPremise\u202f2 (\u201cNo deeples are plantles\u201d) does **not** guarantee that any deeples exist at all; it merely sets an *impossibility* for the overlapping set {deeple} \u2229 {plantle}. Without an explicit assertion that deeples exist, the conclusion\u2019s existential claim cannot be supported.\n\n---\n\n#### 3.

In classic categorical logic, any syllogism containing a **negative premise** cannot conclude with a **particular negative** proposition. Moreover, the conclusion asserts the existence of a deeple that is not a swimble, but no premise guarantees that such a deeple exists.

The argument fails to establish the existence of any screwdrivers  \nPremise\u202f2 is a universal statement (\u201cNo\u202fS are\u202fH\u201d). It does **not** assert that any screwdrivers exist; it only says that if a screwdriver exists, it cannot be heavy.  \nThe conclusion, however, introduces an existential claim: \u201cSome screwdrivers are not tools.\u201d  Introducing an existence claim (the \u201csome\u201d part) that is not supported by the premises is the *existential fallacy*.\n\n---\n\n#### 3.  Logical consequence check  \nEven if we assume perfectly large populations where every category is non\u2011empty, the premises give **no relationship** between screwdrivers (**S**) and tools (**T**) except through the property \u201cheavy.\u201d  \nFrom\n\n- \u201cSome T are H\u201d and  \n- \u201cNo S are H\u201d\n\nno inference can be made about whether any S is a T or not.  \nAn explicit counter\u2011example can be constructed:\n\n| object | T | H | S |\n|--------|---|---|---|\n| a | *Yes* | *Yes* | *No* |\n| b | *No* | *No* | *No* |\n\nBoth premises hold, yet **no** screwdriver (in the universe) is present, so the conclusion would be false.

The conclusion introduces an existential claim that the premises do not justify,\n\nthe syllogism is **incorrect** (invalid). The correct conclusion that follows from the premises would be:\n\n> \u201cNo screwdrivers are tools\u201d **cannot** be inferred; we only know that screwdrivers (if they exist) are not heavy.\n\nHence the given syllogism is logically invalid.",

Why the syllogistic pattern fails\n\n| Requirement | Observation |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| **Middle term must be distributed in at least one premise** | \u201cHeavy\u201d is distributed in Premise\u202f2 (\u201cNo\u202fScrewdrivers\u202fare\u202fHeavy\u201d), so this rule is satisfied. |\n| **If a premise is particular, the conclusion cannot be universal** | Not relevant here; conclusion is particular. |\n| **If a premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative** | Conclusion is negative \u2013 rule satisfied. |\n| **The shape of the syllogistic figure** | The conclusion\u2019s subject (\u201cscrewdrivers\u201d) does **not** appear as the subject in any premise: the premises involve \u201ctools\u202f&\u202fheavy\u201d and \u201cscrewdrivers\u202f&\u202fheavy\u201d. Thus, the conclusion cannot be derived in a figure\u20111, 2, or 3 syllogism. |\n\nThe premises provide no linkage between \u201cscrewdrivers\u201d and \u201ctools\u201d except through \u201cheavy\u201d.  Because all screwdrivers are **non\u2011heavy**, the premises do **not** preclude the possibility that some screwdrivers are also tools (just non\u2011heavy).  Therefore no inference can be made that *some* screwdrivers are necessarily *not* tools.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe syllogism:\n\n> **Premise\u202f1:** Some tools are heavy.  \n> **Premise\u202f2:** No screwdrivers are heavy.  \n> **Conclusion:** Therefore, some screwdrivers are not tools.\n\nis **incorrect** \u2013 it is not a valid categorical syllogism.

Why the conclusion is not forced\n\nThe conclusion, \u201csome screwdrivers are not tools,\u201d would follow only if we knew that:\n\n* there exists at least one screwdriver, **and**\n* no screwdriver happens to also be a tool.\n\nThe premises give no information about the *existence* of screwdrivers at all, nor about whether a given screwdriver might also be classified as a tool. The conclusion is therefore not entailed.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Categorical\u2011syllogistic perspective\n\nIn categorical logic we have:\n\n- Premise\u202f1: I\u2011form (Some *T* are *H*)  \n- Premise\u202f2: E\u2011form (No *S* are *H*)  \n- Conclusion: O\u2011form (Some *S* are not *T*)\n\nThe valid moods that combine an I\u2011 and an E\u2011premise never give an O\u2011conclusion. The \u201cundistributed middle\u201d problem also signals that the middle term (*Heavy*) is not distributed in either premise, so the conclusion cannot be guaranteed.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe syllogism:\n\n1. Some tools are heavy.  \n2. No screwdrivers are heavy.  \n3. **\u2234 Some screwdrivers are not tools.**\n\nfails to follow logically. Hence it is **incorrect** (invalid).",

Check the validity of I\u2013E\u2013O in Figure\u202f3\n\nThe canonical valid moods for Figure\u202f3 are:  \n- **Ferio** (I\u2013E\u2013O) \u2013 **valid**  \n- **Darii** (A\u2013E\u2013I) \u2013 invalid  \n\nBut we must confirm the mood *I\u2013E\u2013O* is indeed **valid** in Figure\u202f3.  \nIt is **not** one of the traditionally accepted valid forms.  \nThe only valid moods in Figure\u202f3 are, for instance, **Baroko**, **Branco**, **Boaro**, etc.  \n**I\u2013E\u2013O** is **not** among them.\n\nAnother way: apply the classic rules of distribution.\n\n| Rule | Does it hold? |\n|------|---------------|\n| Middle term must be distributed in at least one premise | \u2714 **No T are W** distributes W (predicate). |\n| Every term appears at least twice | \u2714 W appears twice; F and T appear only once each (acceptable). |\n| If a term is distributed in a premise it must be distributed in the conclusion *if* the conclusion is universal | N/A (conclusion O). |\n| At least one premise must be universal | \u2714 E\u2011premise. |\n\nAll the superficial rules are satisfied, but that is **not enough**.

Hence the syllogism violates the rule of distribution.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Try to find a known valid mood\n\nThe only two\u2011premise valid moods that end with an **O** conclusion (Some\u202fC\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fA) are of the form **I\u2011E\u2011O**, but the standard textbooks list **no** valid syllogism with that mood. In other words, the combination I\u2011E\u2011O is intrinsically invalid.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Examine the logical content\n\nLet\u2019s think concretely. Suppose\n\n* Some fixbles are weightble \u2013 e.g.\u201cSome A are B.\u201d  \n* No turnles are weightble \u2013 \u201cNo C are B.\u201d\n\nFrom these we can *only* say:\n\n1. There is at least one fixble that is weightble.  \n2. No turnle can be weightble.\n\nNothing connects **turnles** and **fixbles** directly. It is perfectly consistent with both premises for **every** turnle to be a fixble. In that case the conclusion \u201cSome turnles are not fixbles\u201d would be false. Therefore the conclusion does **not** follow from the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

What the premises actually assert\n\n1. **Existence of a weightble fixble**  \n   There is at least one object that is both a fixble and weightble.\n\n2. **All turnles *cannot* be weightble**  \n   If the name \u201cturnle\u201d is applied to any object, that object is guaranteed **not** to be weightble.\n\n   *Notice that this premise does **not** say anything about whether\n   a turnle can be a fixble or not.*\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Observations that break a direct inference\n\n| Observation | Why it matters |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| **No link between \u201cfixble\u201d and \u201cturnle\u201d** | Premises never connect the two kinds of things. |\n| **Possible emptiness of the class \u201cturnle\u201d** | The second premise is *vacuously true* if there are no turnles at all, yet the conclusion would be false (\u201cthere is no turnle that is not a fixble\u201d because no turnle exists). |\n| **All turnles could be fixbles** | It is perfectly consistent with both premises that every turnle that exists is also a fixble (e.g., there are 3 fixble\u2011turnles, all non\u2011weightble). Then the conclusion \u201csome turnles are not fixbles\u201d is false. |\n\nBecause any of the above can happen while the premises remain true, we cannot logically guarantee the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Categorical\u2011syllogism point of view  \n\nIf we view the syllogism as a categorical proof, it has the form  \n\n```\nSome A are B.          (Particular affirmative)\nNo C are B.            (Universal negative)\nTherefore, some C are not A.   (Particular negative)\n```\n\nIn categorical logic a syllogism is **valid only if the middle term B is distributed in at least one premise** (or the conclusion uses a predicted distribution). Here, **neither premise distributes** B:\n\n- In \u201cSome A are B\u201d both terms are undistributed.\n- In \u201cNo C are B\u201d the subject C is distributed, the predicate B is not.\n  \nThus B is undistributed in all premises, violating the *distribution rule* and rendering the argument invalid.  \n\n---\n\n## 5.  Consequence\n\nBecause the premises do **not** ensure either of the following:\n\n1. that at least one turnle exists, **and**\n2. that any existing turnle is *not* a fixble,\n\nthe conclusion \u201cSome turnles are not fixbles\u201d does **not** follow from the premises.

This is **Figure 2** of Aristotelian syllogistic logic.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Validity check  \n\nAn E\u2011I\u2011O syllogism in Figure\u202f2 is *not* one of the classically valid moods. We can confirm this constructively by exhibiting a counter\u2011model where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.\n\n#### Counter\u2011example (model)\n\n- **Domain**: {\u202fv\u2081, n\u2081\u202f}  \n  - \\(v_1\\) = \u201cvitamin tablet\u201d  \n  - \\(n_1\\) = \u201cnutritional thing\u201d  \n\n- **Interpretations**:  \n  - \\(S\\) (\u201cvitamin tablets\u201d) = {\u202fv\u2081\u202f}  \n  - \\(P\\) (\u201cnutritional things\u201d) = {\u202fv\u2081,\u202fn\u2081\u202f} (so the vitamin tablet is also a nutritional thing)  \n  - \\(M\\) (\u201cexpensive\u201d) = {\u202fn\u2081\u202f}  \n\nNow verify each premise:\n\n1. **No S are M**  \n   - \\(S \\cap M = \\{v\u2081\\} \\cap \\{n\u2081\\} = \\varnothing\\).  \n   - True.\n\n2. **Some P are M**  \n   - \\(P \\cap M = \\{v\u2081,\u202fn\u2081\\} \\cap \\{n\u2081\\} = \\{n\u2081\\}\\neq\\varnothing\\).  \n   - True.\n\nCheck the conclusion:\n\n- **Some S are not P**  \n  - \\(S \\cap \\overline{P}\\) = \\{v\u2081\\} \u2229 (complement of \\{v\u2081,n\u2081\\}) = \u2205.  \n  - False.\n\nThus the premises can simultaneously be true while the conclusion is false. Therefore the syllogism **cannot** be valid.\n\n---\n\n### 5.  Intuitive explanation\n\n- Premise\u202f1 only tells us that *none* of the vitamin tablets are expensive.  \n- Premise\u202f2 tells us that *some* nutritional things are expensive; it does **not** tell us which nutritional things, nor does it restrict how vitamin tablets relate to other nutritional things.\n\nFrom these two facts we cannot deduce whether *some* vitamin tablet is **not** a nutritional thing.  \nIt is perfectly consistent that all vitamin tablets are nutritional things (and, due to premise\u202f1, simply not expensive).  \n\nHence the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\n---\n\n## Final verdict\n\nThe syllogism\n\n> **Premise\u202f1:** No vitamin tablets are expensive.  \n> **Premise\u202f2:** Some nutritional things are expensive.  \n> **Conclusion:** Therefore, some vitamin tablets are not nutritional things.\n\nis **incorrect** \u2013 it is an **invalid** categorical syllogism.",

An O\u2011conclusion requires at least one premise to be existential (i.e., of type I or O). Premise\u202f2 is existential (Some P are M), so that's satisfied.

Logical structure of an IE\u2011oop\nIn a valid categorical syllogism the following must hold (classical rules):\n\n| Rule | Application to our case |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **1. Distribution** | Every term that appears in the conclusion must be distributed (i.e., occur in a universal premise or as a subject of a universal premise). |\n| **2. Quality** | A negative premise or conclusion introduces an *or* (An), but a negative conclusion must have a *particular* premise to be valid. |\n| **3. Consistency of the middle term** | The middle term must be distributed at least once and appear in one premise. |\n\n### Check these rules:\n\n| Rule | Check |\n|------|-------|\n| 1. Distribution | In the conclusion `Some V are not N`, the subject V is *not distributed* (it's a particular subject). The object N is also *not distributed*. Therefore the conclusion is a particular negative (O), which is allowed if at least one premise is particular. We have one particular premise (Premise 1). So this passes. |\n| 2. Quality | The conclusion is negative (O). In standard logic a negative conclusion requires **at least one** negative premise, which we have (Premise 2). So this passes. |\n| 3. Middle term (E) | The middle term \u201cexpensive\u201d appears as the predicate in Premise\u202f1 (I) and as the predicate in Premise\u202f2 (E). In both cases it is **not** distributed (predicate of a particular premise is not distributed, predicate of a universal negative *is* distributed). But a middle term must be distributed at least **once**. Here it is distributed in Premise\u202f2 (because \u201cNo V are E\u201d has predicate E distributed). So this passes. |\n\nSuperficially the syllogism *seems* to satisfy the classic validity tests. However, these rules are *necessary but not sufficient* for syllogistic validity when the mood is IEO in the first figure. The more important point is that **the premises do not logically entail the conclusion**; we can actually create a counter\u2011example.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Counter\u2011example (model that satisfies premises, not conclusion)\n\nLet the universe U contain exactly two items:\n\n| Item | Is it a vitamin tablet? | Is it a nutritional thing? | Is it expensive? |\n|------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| a | Yes | Yes | No |\n| b | No | Yes | Yes |\n\nCheck the premises:\n\n1. **Premise\u202f1**: \u201cSome nutritional things are expensive.\u201d  \n   *Explanation:* Object\u202fb is a nutritional thing and expensive \u2013 so the premise is true.\n\n2. **Premise\u202f2**: \u201cNo vitamin tablets are expensive.\u201d  \n   *Explanation:* The only vitamin tablet is a, and it isn\u2019t expensive \u2013 the premise is true.\n\nNow evaluate the conclusion:\n\n- \u201cSome vitamin tablets are not nutritional things.\u201d  \n  We would need a vitamin tablet that is *not* a nutritional thing. The only vitamin tablet, a, **is** a nutritional thing. So the conclusion is **false** in this model.\n\nBecause we have a structure (model) where **both premises are true** and **the conclusion is false**, the syllogism is invalid. By the definition of logical consequence, a valid syllogism must have the conclusion logically follow from the premises in *all* models. This example shows a counter\u2011model, so the syllogism fails.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Intuition / informal reasoning\n\n- Premise\u202f1 tells us that *some* nutritional things cost a lot, but it does **not** specify that those expensive ones are vitamin tablets.  \n- Premise\u202f2 tells us that *none* of the vitamin tablets cost a lot, but it does **not** forbid vitamin tablets from being nutritional in the first place; they might simply be cheap.  \n- From these two facts we can only say: \u201cVitamin tablets are not expensive.\u201d Nothing forces them to be non\u2011nutritional. An additional premise (\u201cAll vitamin tablets are non\u2011nutritional\u201d) would be required to reach the conclusion.\n\nHence no inference can be drawn that some vitamin tablets *must* be non\u2011nutritional.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

The conclusion \"No poisons are harmful\" does **not** logically follow from the premises. \n\n### Key Flaw:\n- Premise 1: **No harmful substance is natural** (E-type, \"All harmful substances are not natural\").\n- Premise 2: **All poisons are natural** (A-type).\n- Conclusion: **No poisons are harmful** (E-type).\n\n### Logical Analysis:\n1. **Middle Term (\"natural\")** is in the predicate of **both premises** (second figure). In valid syllogisms in the second figure, **at least one premise must be negative** and **the conclusion must be negative**.\n2. While the first premise is negative and the conclusion is negative, the syllogism fails the **\"distributed term\" rule**: the **middle term (\"natural\") must be distributed at least once**. In this case:\n   - Premise 1 is \"No harmful substance is natural\" (E-type), so \"natural\" is not distributed (E-type does not distribute the predicate term).\n   - Premise 2 is \"All poisons are natural\" (A-type), so \"natural\" is not distributed (in A-type, only the subject is distributed).\n   - Thus, the **middle term (\"natural\") is not distributed in either premise**. This violates a fundamental rule of syllogistic validity.\n\n3. The conclusion incorrectly assumes that being \"natural\" prevents something from being \"harmful\", but the premises do not establish this relationship. The logic incorrectly conflates categories, leading to an invalid inference.\n\n### Why This Matters:\nEven if we rephrase the first premise as \"No harmful substances are natural\" (which is equivalent to \"No natural things are harmful\"), the syllogism's structure fails because the **middle term is not properly distributed**. The conclusion does **not** necessarily follow from the premises.",

Premise 1 states a fact about cars (\"need oil\"), and Premise 2 states a general rule (\"all things with an engine need oil\"). However, these premises do not establish a definitive connection between cars and engines. The syllogism commits the *affirming the consequent* fallacy: just because all engine-equipped objects require oil (Engine \u2192 Oil), it does not follow that all oil-consuming objects (e.g., cars) must have engines. There could be other reasons cars require oil (e.g., lubricating moving parts unrelated to engines). Thus, the conclusion is not necessarily valid based on the premises alone.",

The premises establish a relationship about **millionaires** and **rich people** indirectly via **scientists**, but they do **not** provide direct evidence that **any rich people exist outside of millionaires**.  \n   - For example, \"rich people\" could all be millionaires, yet the premises would still hold: some millionaires are scientists, and scientists are not rich people. In this case, the conclusion \"some rich people are not millionaires\" would be false.  \n\n5. **Logical Structure:**  \n   - The premises only allow us to infer that **some M are not R** (millionaires who are scientists are not rich people).  \n   - The conclusion \"some R are not M\" is the **converse** of this and is **not logically derivable** from the premises.  \n\n**Answer:** The syllogism is **incorrect** because the premises do not logically support the conclusion. \n\nAnswer: incorrect",

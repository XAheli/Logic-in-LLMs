Formal syllogistic perspective\n\nIn categorical logic the premises are:\n\n1. **All M are F** \u2013 universal affirmative (A\u2011form).  \n2. **No R are F** \u2013 universal negative (E\u2011form).\n\nThe conclusion is a particular affirmative (**Some M are R**, a I\u2011form).\n\nNo valid categorical syllogism has the form:\n\n```\nAll M are F\nNo R are F\n\u2234 Some M are R\n```\n\nThe mood and figure do not match any of the 19 valid forms in the standard Aristotelian system.

Determine the form of the syllogism** |  The structure is: **All S are M; No P are M; Therefore, No S are P**.  <br>  This is the classic *EAE\u20111* (or *Darii* in some traditions) form. |  EAE\u20111 is a well\u2011known valid categorical syllogism. |\n| **5. Verify the conclusion** |  The conclusion is **No S are P** (No poisons are harmful substances).  <br>  Both terms in the conclusion are distributed, which is permissible because the middle term was distributed in the premises. |  The conclusion follows logically from the premises. |\n| **6.

The premises themselves are unrealistic (they contradict empirical knowledge), but that does not affect the logical validity of the argument.

Because **F** is undistributed, the syllogism fails this rule.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Logical form (undistributed middle)\n\nThe structure is:\n\n```\nAll S are F.\nAll G are F.\n\u2234 All S are G.\n```\n\nThis is the classic *undistributed middle* fallacy. The middle term **F** (framble) is the same in both premises, but it never narrows down the relationship between **S** and **G**. The premises only say that both **S** and **G** belong to the larger set **F**; they do **not** say that the sets **S** and **G** overlap.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Counter\u2011example\n\nSuppose we have:\n\n- **S**: Snazzles that need framble for a *different* reason (e.g., they are fragile and need framble to protect them).\n- **G**: Things with a glibbet that need framble (e.g., a particular type of bird that has a glibbet and needs framble for nesting).\n\nBoth sets satisfy the premises:\n\n- All snazzles (S) need framble (F).\n- All glibbets (G) need framble (F).\n\nBut **none** of the snazzles necessarily have glibbets. Thus the conclusion \u201cAll snazzles have glibbets\u201d is false in this scenario.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do not logically entail the conclusion (the middle term is undistributed and the syllogism is a classic fallacy), the syllogism is **incorrect**.",

If every member of set\u202fC belongs to set\u202fS, and every member of set\u202fS belongs to set\u202fB, then every member of set\u202fC must belong to set\u202fB.\n\n---\n\n## Quick check\n\n1. **All A are B** (A \u2192 B)  \n2. **All B are C** (B \u2192 C)  \n3. **Therefore, all A are C** (A \u2192 C)\n\nThis is a textbook valid syllogism (Barbara). No logical fallacies (e.g., affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent, etc.) are present.\n\n---\n\n### Caveat: Truth vs. Validity\n\n- **Validity**: The syllogism is *logically* correct; the conclusion follows from the premises.  \n- **Truth of premises**: Whether cigarettes are actually smoked, or whether all smoked things are truly bad for health, is a separate empirical question. Even if one premise is false, the inference remains *valid*; it would just be a *fallacious* argument only if the premises were both false and the conclusion false.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe syllogism is **correct** (valid). The conclusion that \u201ccigarettes are bad for your health\u201d follows logically from the two premises.",

(C = cigarettes, S = smoked things)\n   All S are P.   (P = bad for your health)\n   ----------------\n   Therefore, all C are P.\n   ```\n\n   This is the classic *Barbara* form of a categorical syllogism (AAA\u20111), which is valid.\n\n3. **Logical inference**\n\n   From the two premises we can deduce:\n\n   - Every cigarette is smoked (Premise\u202f1).\n   - Every smoked thing is bad for your health (Premise\u202f2).\n\n   Therefore, every cigarette is bad for your health. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\n---\n\n### Caveats (not part of the logical validity)\n\n- **Truth of the premises**: The syllogism\u2019s validity doesn\u2019t guarantee that the premises are true.  \n  - Premise\u202f1 is generally true (people do smoke cigarettes).  \n  - Premise\u202f2 is a broad generalization that may not hold for all smoked items (e.g., some smoked foods might not be harmful).  \n\n- **Scope of \u201csmoked\u201d**: The argument assumes \u201csmoked\u201d applies uniformly to cigarettes and to all other items. If \u201csmoked\u201d is interpreted differently (e.g., \u201csmoked food\u201d vs. \u201csmoked tobacco\u201d), the premises might not align perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n**The syllogism is *logically valid*\u2014the conclusion follows from the premises.** Whether the conclusion is factually correct depends on the truth of the premises and the precise interpretation of the terms, but that is separate from the logical structure itself.",

The argument does **not** commit a logical fallacy; it follows the correct deductive structure.\n\n---\n\n### Possible caveats\n\n1. **Ambiguity of \u201cCigarettes are smoked.\u201d**  \n   - If the speaker intended *\u201cSome cigarettes are smoked\u201d* (existential quantification), the form would be **Some\u202fC\u202fare\u202fS**. In that case the syllogism would be invalid, because from \u201cSome\u202fC\u202fare\u202fS\u201d and \u201cAll\u202fS\u202fare\u202fB\u201d we cannot conclude \u201cAll\u202fC\u202fare\u202fB.\u201d  \n   - However, the conventional interpretation of \u201cX are Y\u201d in categorical logic is universal (\u201cAll\u202fX\u202fare\u202fY\u201d), so the argument is taken as valid.\n\n2. **Truth of the premises.**  \n   - The validity of the syllogism does **not** depend on whether the premises are actually true in the real world. Even if both premises are false, the argument remains logically correct (valid).  \n   - In practice, one might question the factual accuracy of the premises (e.g., whether all cigarettes are indeed smoked, or whether all smoked things are necessarily bad for your health), but that is a separate issue of *soundness*.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe syllogism is **logically correct** (valid). It follows the standard categorical form that guarantees the conclusion from the premises. If you interpret the first premise as a universal statement, the argument is solid; if you interpret it as an existential statement, the argument would be invalid.

Premise\u202f2 can be contraposed (or equivalently, rewritten) as  \n   \\[\n   M(x) \\rightarrow \\lnot V(x)\n   \\]\n   because \u201cif \\(x\\) is a video recorder then it is not metal\u201d is logically equivalent to \u201cif \\(x\\) is metal then it is not a video recorder.\u201d\n3.

Intuitive (English\u2011language) explanation\n\n1. There is at least one electric appliance that is metal.  \n2. No metal thing can be a video recorder.  \n3. Therefore, that particular metal electric appliance cannot be a video recorder.  \n4. Consequently, **some** electric appliance (the metal one) is **not** a video recorder.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  About categorical\u2011syllogism form\n\nIn the strict categorical\u2011syllogism framework, the middle term must appear in the subject position of one premise and in the predicate position of the other.  \nHere the middle term \u201cmetal\u201d appears as a predicate in both premises, so the argument is *not* a standard categorical syllogism in the traditional sense.\n\nHowever, the logical inference is still valid: the premises logically entail the conclusion, as shown above.  \nThus, **the syllogism is correct** in terms of logical validity, even though it does not fit the classic categorical syllogism template.",

From Premise\u202f2 we know there is at least one object, call it \\(a\\), such that  \n   \\[\n   Z(a) \\land F(a)\n   \\]\n2. Premise\u202f1 tells us that for **every** object, if it is a quibble then it is **not** frobny.  \n   In logical form:  \n   \\[\n   Q(a) \\rightarrow \\lnot F(a)\n   \\]\n3. The contrapositive of that implication is logically equivalent:  \n   \\[\n   F(a) \\rightarrow \\lnot Q(a)\n   \\]\n4. Since we already know \\(F(a)\\) holds, we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\(\\lnot Q(a)\\).\n5. Therefore, for the same object \\(a\\) we have both \\(Z(a)\\) and \\(\\lnot Q(a)\\).  \n   That is,  \n   \\[\n   Z(a) \\land \\lnot Q(a)\n   \\]\n6. Hence, there exists an object that is a zankle **and** not a quibble, which is exactly the conclusion:  \n   \\[\n   \\exists x \\bigl( Z(x) \\land \\lnot Q(x) \\bigr)\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n### Categorical\u2011logic view\n\nIn categorical\u2011logic terms the syllogism is:\n\n- **Major premise (E)**: No Q are F.  \n- **Minor premise (I)**: Some Z are F.  \n- **Conclusion (O)**: Some Z are not Q.\n\nThis is the classic **EIO** form in **figure\u202f3** (or figure\u202f2 depending on how you number the figures), which is a **valid** syllogistic pattern. The middle term (F) is distributed in the major premise but not in the minor, and the conclusion correctly distributes the major term (Q) and the minor term (Z) as required for an O\u2011type conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises logically entail the conclusion, the syllogism is **valid**.

The mood \\(EIO\\) in figure\u202f2 is *not* a standard valid form. |\n| **Conclusion** | Despite the non\u2011standard figure, the argument is still logically valid because the premises guarantee the existence of a fish that is not a trout. |\n\nSo, while the syllogism is **not** in a textbook categorical form, it is nevertheless **correct**: the premises logically entail the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The syllogism is **valid** \u2013 the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.",

The middle term \\(L\\) is distributed in Premise\u202f2 (E\u2011type) and is not distributed in Premise\u202f1 (I\u2011type), which is allowed because the conclusion is a particular statement (O\u2011type) and the middle term need not be distributed in the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Caveat: Content vs. Form\n\n- **Formally** (in terms of categorical logic), the syllogism is **valid**.\n- **Contentually**, the premises are contradictory in the real world:  \n  - Grasses are plants, and plants are living things.  \n  - Premise\u202f2 (\u201cNo plants are living things\u201d) is false.  \n  - Because the premises are inconsistent, the argument is *unsound* (i.e., it doesn\u2019t provide a true conclusion based on true premises).  \n\nBut logical validity is concerned only with the form, not the truth of the premises.

The middle term\nIn a categorical syllogism the *middle term* (the term that appears in both premises) must be **distributed at least once**.  \nHere the middle term is **B** (\u201cbliving things\u201d), and it is **not distributed** in either premise (it appears only as the predicate in both E and I statements).  \nBecause B is never distributed, the syllogism fails the basic distribution requirement.\n\n### 2. Compare with standard valid forms\nThe classic valid form that would yield the conclusion \u201cSome S are not D\u201d is **EIO**:\n\n```\nNo M are P.          (E \u2013 M is distributed)\nSome S are M.        (I \u2013 M is not distributed)\n--------------------\nSome S are not P.    (O \u2013 P is distributed)\n```\n\nIn that form the middle term **M** is distributed in the first premise.  \nIn our syllogism the equivalent of **M** is **B**, but B is not distributed in the first premise (\u201cNo D are B\u201d), so the structure is **not** EIO.\n\n### 3.

This is precisely the conclusion:  \n   \\[\n   \\exists x\\; (x \\in P \\land \\neg (x \\in R)).\n   \\]\n\nBecause every step follows from the previous ones using only valid rules of inference (existential instantiation, universal instantiation, modus ponens, and conjunction), the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

In classical categorical logic, the mood **IOE\u20114** is *not* one of the standard valid moods. Therefore, strictly speaking, the syllogism does **not** belong to the set of *canonical* categorical syllogisms.\n\nHowever, the logical analysis above shows that the argument is **sound**: the premises indeed entail the conclusion. The apparent mismatch with the standard forms is due to the fact that the conclusion is a particular negative, which is not allowed in the usual categorical moods for figure\u202f4. The argument is still valid in ordinary logic, even though it does not fit the narrow schema of classical syllogistic moods.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Bottom line\n\n- **Logical validity**: \u2714\u202fThe conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.  \n- **Classical categorical form**: \u274c\u202fIt is not one of the standard valid moods (IOE\u20114).  \n\n**Therefore, the syllogism is correct (logically valid), even though it does not conform to the traditional categorical syllogism templates.**",

From (1) and (2) we can conclude that **some** video recorders are **not** electric appliances (since those metal\u2011containing video recorders cannot be in *E*).  \n   - Symbolically: Some\u202fV\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fE.\n\n4. The conclusion, however, asks about the opposite direction: *some* electric appliances that are **not** video recorders.  \n   - There is no information that guarantees that not every electric appliance is a video recorder.  \n   - It is perfectly consistent with the premises that **all** electric appliances are video recorders.  \n     *Example:*  \n     - Let *E* = {electric stove, electric bulb}.  \n     - Let *V* = {electric stove, electric bulb, video recorder}.  \n     - Let *M* = {video recorder}.  \n     Here, premises 1 and 2 hold, but the conclusion \u201csome E are not V\u201d is false.\n\nBecause the premises do **not** logically force the conclusion, the syllogism is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### Correct categorical form\n\nIf we wanted a valid conclusion from these premises, it would be:\n\n> **Conclusion:** Some video recorders are not electric appliances.\n\nThis follows the standard categorical syllogism pattern:\n\n| Major Premise | Minor Premise | Conclusion |\n|---------------|---------------|------------|\n| No\u202fE\u202fare\u202fM | Some\u202fV\u202fare\u202fM | Some\u202fV\u202fare\u202fnot\u202fE |\n\nBut the given conclusion is the wrong direction, so the syllogism is **incorrect**.",

Does the conclusion follow from the premises?\n\nTo be valid, every model that satisfies the two premises must also satisfy the conclusion.  \nIf we can find *one* model (interpretation) that satisfies the premises but **fails** the conclusion, the syllogism is invalid.\n\n### Counter\u2011model\n\n| Item | Category |\n|------|----------|\n| Toaster | electric appliance (E) \u2013 **not** metal |\n| Lamp | electric appliance (E) \u2013 **not** metal |\n| VHS player | video recorder (V) \u2013 **metal** |\n| Digital recorder | video recorder (V) \u2013 **not** metal |\n\n*Check the premises*  \n\n1. **No electric appliances are metal** \u2013 true, because the toaster and lamp are not metal.  \n2. **Some video recorders are metal** \u2013 true, because the VHS player is a metal video recorder.\n\n*Check the conclusion*  \n\n- **Some electric appliances are not video recorders** \u2013 false, because *both* electric appliances (toaster and lamp) are also video recorders (they are video recorders that happen to be electric appliances).  \n\nThus the premises can be true while the conclusion is false. Therefore the syllogism is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Why the form is fallacious\n\nThe syllogistic form is:\n\n```\nNo A are B.\nSome C are B.\n------------\nSome A are not C.\n```\n\nIn terms of categorical logic:\n\n- **Premise 1** (No A are B) distributes *B* (the middle term) **only** in the negative sense, but *B* is **undistributed** in the premise (it is not the subject of the statement).\n- **Premise 2** (Some C are B) does **not** distribute *B* at all.\n- The conclusion (Some A are not C) does not involve *B*.\n\nBecause *B* is undistributed in all premises and not present in the conclusion, the middle term is *undistributed* in the argument. This violates the **distribution rule** of categorical syllogisms, which requires that the middle term be distributed in at least one premise. Hence the argument is a classic example of an *undistributed middle* fallacy.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Bottom line\n\n- **Premises**: \u201cNo electric appliances are metal things\u201d **and** \u201cSome video recorders are metal things\u201d  \n- **Conclusion**: \u201cSome electric appliances are not video recorders\u201d\n\nThe conclusion does **not** logically follow from the premises.

In other words, there exists a skyscraper that is **not** a building.\n\n> **Key point:** The premises give us an existential fact about a *skyscraper that is not a building*, not about a *building that is not a skyscraper*.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Does that entail the conclusion?\n\nThe conclusion requires the existence of a building that is *not* a skyscraper. The premises do **not** provide any such information.

Why the premises do *not* guarantee the conclusion\n\n### 4.1 No existential import for \u201chighly\u2011trained dogs\u201d\n\n- Premise\u202f1 is a universal statement of the form \u201cAll HT are \u00acV.\u201d  \n- In classical categorical logic, a universal statement **does not** assert the existence of members of the subject class.  \n- Therefore, from Premise\u202f1 alone we cannot conclude that any highly\u2011trained dogs exist.\n\n### 4.2 The existence of a vicious police dog is irrelevant\n\n- Premise\u202f2 tells us that at least one police dog is vicious.  \n- This fact does **not** constrain the relationship between the *set of highly\u2011trained dogs* and the *set of police dogs*.\n- It is perfectly possible that **all** highly\u2011trained dogs are police dogs (and all non\u2011vicious), while the vicious police dog is a different, non\u2011highly\u2011trained dog.  \n- Thus, the premises allow the possibility that every highly\u2011trained dog *is* a police dog, which would make the conclusion false.\n\n### 4.3 Counter\u2011model illustration\n\n| Dog | Highly\u2011trained (HT) | Police dog (PD) | Vicious (V) |\n|-----|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| A   | Yes                 | Yes             | No          |\n| B   | No                  | Yes             | Yes         |\n\n- Premise\u202f1: All HT (A) are not V \u2192 true.  \n- Premise\u202f2: Some PD (B) are V \u2192 true.  \n- Conclusion: Some HT are not PD \u2192 false (there is no HT that is not PD).\n\nThis simple counter\u2011model shows that the premises can be true while the conclusion is false.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

It only says that *if* a thing is skrobble, then it cannot be grumply. The syllogism would be invalid if the class of skrobble things is empty.  \n\n2. **No relationship between skrobble and floffer**  \n   The premises give no information about how skrobble things and floffers overlap (or don\u2019t overlap). From \u201cNo\u202fS\u202fare\u202fG\u201d and \u201cSome\u202fF\u202fare\u202fG\u201d we cannot deduce anything about the intersection of S and F.  \n\n3. **Logical form**  \n   The form is:  \n   ```\n   No S are G\n   Some F are G\n   ------------\n   Some S are not F\n   ```  \n   This is a classic invalid pattern. The middle term (G) is undistributed in the first premise and distributed in the second, but the conclusion draws a relationship between S and F that is not supported by the premises.  \n\n4. **Counter\u2011example**  \n   - Let the universe be {a, b}.  \n   - Let a be a skrobble thing and a *not* a floffer.  \n   - Let b be a floffer and b *not* a skrobble thing.  \n   - Assign \u201cgrumply\u201d to b only.  \n   Then:  \n   - No skrobble things are grumply (a is not grumply).  \n   - Some floffers are grumply (b).  \n   - But there is **no** skrobble thing that is not a floffer? Actually a is a skrobble thing that is not a floffer, so the conclusion holds.

The syllogism is **invalid**.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  What about the contradiction?\n\nIf we *do* impose the real\u2011world fact that trout are fish (T \u2286 F), the premises become contradictory:\n\n- Premise\u202f1: Some T are C \u2192 T \u2229 C \u2260 \u2205  \n- Premise\u202f2: No F are C \u2192 F \u2229 C = \u2205  \n- Since T \u2286 F, we must have T \u2229 C = \u2205, contradicting Premise\u202f1.\n\nFrom contradictory premises, *any* conclusion can be derived (principle of explosion). However, the presence of a contradiction does **not** make the syllogism *valid*; it merely makes it unsound. The conclusion is still not a *necessary* consequence of the premises.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Intuitive explanation\n\n- Premise\u202f1 tells us that **no swimbles are brightle things**.\n- Premise\u202f2 tells us that **at least one speckle is a brightle thing**.\n- From these, we can only deduce that **there is some speckle that is not a swimbles** (because that speckle is a brightle thing and no swimbles are brightle things).  \n- We cannot deduce anything about the relationship between swimbles and speckles beyond that.  \n- In particular, we cannot guarantee that *some* swimbles are *not* speckles; it might be that all swimbles are speckles, or that there are no swimbles at all.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Conclusion\n\nThe syllogism\n\n> **Premise\u202f1:** No swimbles are brightle things.  \n> **Premise\u202f2:** Some speckles are brightle things.  \n> **Conclusion:** Therefore, some swimbles are not speckles.\n\nis **incorrect** (invalid).

Does the conclusion logically follow?\n\nFrom **P1** we know *no* rich person can be a scientist.  \nFrom **P2** we know there is at least one person who **is** a scientist and a millionaire.  \nTherefore that particular scientist\u2011millionaire **cannot** be rich.  \n\nWhat we have proven is the existence of a millionaire who is **not** rich:\n\n> \u2203x (Millionaire(x) \u2227 \u00acRich(x))\n\nBut the conclusion asks for the existence of a rich person who is **not** a millionaire:\n\n> \u2203x (Rich(x) \u2227 \u00acMillionaire(x))\n\nThese are two *different* existential claims. The premises do **not** entail the second one.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Categorical form and fallacy\n\nThe syllogism has the form:\n\n```\nNo R are S.\nSome M are S.\n\u2234 Some R are not M.\n```\n\nThis is a classic example of an **invalid categorical syllogism**. It does not fall under a standard Aristotelian figure (e.g., it\u2019s not a valid 1st\u2011figure form). The middle term *S* is distributed in the first premise but not in the second, and the conclusion introduces a relationship between *R* and *M* that the premises never constrain.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do **not** logically entail the conclusion (as shown by the counter\u2011example), the syllogism is **incorrect** (invalid).",

From Premise\u202f1 we only know that **rich people cannot be scientists**.  \n   This tells us nothing about whether rich people can be millionaires.\n\n2. From Premise\u202f2 we know that **there is at least one millionaire who is a scientist**.  \n   Because scientists are excluded from being rich (Premise\u202f1), that particular millionaire scientist is **not rich**.  \n   This fact does **not** give us any information about *rich* millionaires or about rich people who are not millionaires.\n\n3. It is entirely consistent to have a world where **every rich person is a millionaire**.  \n   In that world:\n   * Premise\u202f1 is still true (rich people are not scientists).\n   * Premise\u202f2 is still true (there is a millionaire scientist who is not rich).\n   * The conclusion \u201csome rich people are not millionaires\u201d is **false** (because all rich people are millionaires).\n\nThus the premises do **not** logically entail the conclusion.

Check the mood and figure\n\nThe syllogism has the mood **E\u2011I\u2011I** (E = universal negative, I = particular affirmative) and the figure depends on the placement of the middle term **B**. The middle term is the second term in the major premise and the first term in the minor premise \u2013 that is **Figure\u202f1**.  \n\nThe standard valid forms for Figure\u202f1 are:\n\n| Valid mood | Form |\n|------------|------|\n| A\u2011I\u2011A | All A are B, Some B are C, therefore Some A are C |\n| E\u2011A\u2011E | No A are B, All B are C, therefore No A are C |\n| I\u2011E\u2011I | Some A are B, No B are C, therefore Some A are not C |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThe mood **E\u2011I\u2011I** is *not* on the list of valid moods for any figure. Therefore, the inference is not valid *by the standard rules of categorical logic*.\n\n### 3.

No, because the only A (a) is also C. Therefore the conclusion is false.\n\nSince there is a counter\u2011example, the syllogism is **invalid**.\n\n### 4. Why it fails logically\n\nThe failure stems from the **undistributed middle** problem:\n\n- In Premise\u202f1 (E), the middle term **B** is *distributed* (both terms are distributed).\n- In Premise\u202f2 (I), the middle term **B** is *not distributed*.\n\nBecause the middle term is distributed in one premise and not in the other, the inference cannot be valid. This violates the distribution requirement for a valid categorical syllogism.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe syllogism\n\n> No wealthble are studdles.  \n> Some richlets are studdles.  \n> Therefore, some wealthble are not richlets.\n\nis **incorrect** (i.e., the conclusion does **not** logically follow from the premises).",

Can we derive that from the premises?\n\nNo.  \nFrom the premises we can only infer that:\n\n* Every **S** is **not** a **P** (because \\(S \\cap P = \\varnothing\\)).  \n* There exists a **Q** that is a **P** (because of the particular I\u2011statement).\n\nBut we have **no information** about the relationship between **S** and **Q**.  \n\n*It could be that all **S** are also **Q**.*  \n*It could be that some **S** are **Q** and some are not.*  \n*It could be that no **S** are **Q**.*  \n\nIn all these possibilities the premises remain true, yet the conclusion **\u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d** is **false** in the first two cases and true only in the third.  \nBecause we cannot guarantee the existence of an **S** that is not a **Q**, the conclusion does **not** logically follow.\n\n### 4.  Formal check (mood & figure)\n\n* **Mood**: Premise\u202f1 (E), Premise\u202f2 (I), Conclusion (O) \u2192 **EIO**.  \n* **Figure**: The middle term (the term that appears in both premises) is **sparkle**.  \n  In the conclusion the middle term is **soundles**, so the middle term changes.  \n  A proper categorical syllogism requires the middle term to be the same in both premises **and** the conclusion.  \n  Therefore the form is not a valid categorical syllogism.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nBecause the premises do **not** entail the conclusion, and because the syllogism fails the structural requirement of a categorical syllogism (different middle term in the conclusion), the argument is **invalid**. Hence the syllogism is **incorrect**.",

Identify the figure** | The middle term **M** (sparkle) is the predicate in both premises: \u201cSome\u202fP\u202fare\u202fM\u201d and \u201cNo\u202fS\u202fare\u202fM.\u201d  That is **Figure\u202f3** (middle term as predicate in both premises). |\n| **3. Check the mood** | The mood is **S\u202fE\u202fO** (S = particular affirmative, E = universal negative, O = particular negative). |\n| **4. Compare to the list of valid moods for Figure\u202f3** | The only valid moods in Figure\u202f3 are:  <br>\u2022 A\u202fE\u202fE  <br>\u2022 A\u202fI\u202fE  <br>\u2022 I\u202fE\u202fE  <br>\u2022 O\u202fE\u202fO  <br>\u2022 I\u202fE\u202fI  <br>\u2022 O\u202fE\u202fO (the same as the previous one).  <br>**S\u202fE\u202fO is NOT on the list**. |\n| **5.

In classical categorical logic, universal statements (like \u201cNo\u202fS\u202fare\u202fM\u201d) do **not** assert existence.  Thus the conclusion \u201cSome\u202fS\u202fare not\u202fP\u201d could be false if there are no stringles at all.  For example: <br>\u2022 Universe = {soundles, sparkle}.  <br>\u2022 \u201cSome soundles are sparkle\u201d is true.  <br>\u2022 \u201cNo stringles are sparkle\u201d is vacuously true (there are no stringles).  <br>\u2022 \u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d is false (because there are no stringles). |\n| **6.

There exists at least one expensive nutritional thing.\n\nThese two facts do **not** give any information about the relationship between *vitamin tablets* and *nutritional things*.  \nIn particular, they do **not** guarantee the existence of a vitamin tablet that is not nutritional.\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

Formal categorical\u2011logic view\n\nThe syllogism has the mood **EIO** (No A are B; Some C are B; Some A are not C).  \nIn categorical logic, a valid syllogism requires that the middle term (here *expensive*) appear once as a subject and once as a predicate in the premises.  \nIn this case, *expensive* appears only as a predicate, so the figure is invalid.

This fact is unrelated to the nutritional status of vitamin tablets.\n\n3. To derive the conclusion we would need a link between *vitamin tablets* and *nutritional things*. The premises give no such link. The only connection we have is that vitamin tablets are not expensive, and expensive items can be nutritional, but that does not constrain the nutritional status of vitamin tablets.\n\n4. In categorical logic terms, the premises are an **E** (universal negative) and an **I** (particular affirmative). The conclusion is an **O** (particular negative). No valid syllogistic form allows an E and an I premise to support an O conclusion. Hence the argument is invalid.\n\n5. **Counterexample**:  \n   - Suppose there are **no** vitamin tablets at all (the set V is empty).  \n   - Let there be one expensive nutritional item (e.g., a costly supplement).  \n   - Then Premise\u202f1 holds vacuously (no vitamin tablets are expensive).  \n   - Premise\u202f2 holds (the expensive item is nutritional).  \n   - The conclusion \u201csome vitamin tablets are not nutritional\u201d is false, because there are no vitamin tablets to satisfy \u201csome\u201d.\n\nBecause a single counterexample suffices to show that the conclusion is not logically entailed, the syllogism is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe syllogism **does not** follow logically from its premises.

Maybe all other skyscrapers are non-wooden, and thus could be buildings.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that **all buildings are skyscrapers** (but non-wooden ones), and the wooden ones are non-building skyscrapers (which is odd, but logically possible under these premises).\n\nExample:\n\n- Skyscraper A: wooden \u2192 not a building (by P2)  \n- Skyscraper B: steel \u2192 is a building  \n- Skyscraper C: steel \u2192 is a building  \n- Building D: brick \u2192 is a building, not a skyscraper\n\nWait \u2014 but we don\u2019t know if Building D exists.\n\nWe have **no information** about non-skyscraper buildings.\n\nWe only know:\n\n- Some skyscrapers are wooden \u2192 those are not buildings.  \n- All buildings are non-wooden.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if there are any buildings that are not skyscrapers.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that **all buildings are skyscrapers** (but non-wooden ones), and the wooden skyscrapers are non-buildings (perhaps they\u2019re just tall wooden structures not classified as \u201cbuildings\u201d under some definition).\n\nIn that case, **all buildings are skyscrapers**, so \u201csome buildings are not skyscrapers\u201d would be **false**.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does **not** follow from the premises.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer: **The syllogism is incorrect.**\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.  \nWe cannot conclude that some buildings are not skyscrapers based on the given information.  \nIn fact, the premises lead to a contradiction with real-world assumptions, but even within the logic of the statements, the conclusion is not entailed.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Incorrect**",

Could all drinks be liquors?\n\nWell, if a drink is a liquor, and if that liquor is sweet \u2192 then it can\u2019t be a drink (by Premise 1).  \nSo any liquor that is a drink **must not be sweet**.\n\nBut Premise 2 says **some liquors are sweet** \u2014 so those are not drinks.\n\nBut what about **other liquors**?

In traditional logic, \u201cNo A are B\u201d does **not** imply that A exists.  \nSimilarly, \u201cSome soundles are sparkle\u201d **does** assert existence (some = at least one).\n\nSo:  \nWe know **some soundles exist** and they are sparkle \u2192 so those soundles are not stringles.  \nBut we don\u2019t know whether **any stringles exist**.\n\nSuppose **no stringles exist at all**.  \nThen:  \n- Premise 1: \u201cNo stringles are sparkle\u201d \u2014 vacuously true (since there are no stringles).  \n- Premise 2: \u201cSome soundles are sparkle\u201d \u2014 true (as given).  \n- Conclusion: \u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d \u2014 this would be **false**, because there are no stringles at all.  \n  \u201cSome X are Y\u201d requires at least one X to exist.\n\nSo if stringles don\u2019t exist, the conclusion is false, but the premises are still true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion **does not logically follow** from the premises.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any stringles exist, so we cannot conclude that \u201csome stringles are not soundles.\u201d\n\nEven if stringles *do* exist, we don\u2019t know whether they overlap with soundles or not.\n\nSuppose stringles exist. Could all stringles be soundles?\n\nLet\u2019s try to construct a counterexample:\n\n- Let there be 3 objects:  \n  - Object A: soundle and sparkle \u2192 satisfies Premise 2.  \n  - Object B: stringle and soundle \u2192 is this allowed?  \n    - Is B a sparkle? No.  \n    - Premise 1: No stringles are sparkle \u2192 B is not sparkle \u2192 OK.  \n    - So B is a stringle and a soundle \u2192 allowed.  \n  - Object C: stringle and not soundle \u2192 we don\u2019t need this for the counterexample.\n\nIn this model:  \n- Premise 1: No stringles are sparkle \u2192 A is sparkle, not stringle; B and C are stringles, not sparkle \u2192 OK.  \n- Premise 2: Some soundles are sparkle \u2192 A is soundle and sparkle \u2192 OK.  \n- Conclusion: \u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d \u2192 In this model, we have B (stringle and soundle) and possibly C (stringle and not soundle). But we **don\u2019t have to include C**.\n\nWe can have a model where **all stringles are soundles**:\n\n- Stringles: {B}  \n- Soundles: {A, B}  \n- Sparkle: {A}  \n\nCheck:  \n- No stringles are sparkle \u2192 B is stringle, not sparkle \u2192 OK.  \n- Some soundles are sparkle \u2192 A is soundle and sparkle \u2192 OK.  \n- Conclusion: \u201cSome stringles are not soundles\u201d \u2192 But B is a stringle and is a soundle.

There is **no overlap** between deeples and plantles.\n\n**Premise 2**: Some swimbles are plantles.  \n\u2192 This means there is **at least one** element that is in both *swimbles* and *plantles*. So, the set of *swimbles* **overlaps** with the set of *plantles*.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, some deeples are not swimbles.\n\nWe are to determine whether this conclusion **logically follows** from the premises.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From Premise 1:  \n   - All deeples are **outside** the plantles set.  \n   - So: deeples \u2229 plantles = \u2205\n\n2. From Premise 2:  \n   - Some swimbles are plantles \u2192 swimbles \u2229 plantles \u2260 \u2205  \n   - So, there exists at least one thing that is both a swimble and a plantle.\n\n3. Now, the conclusion says: **Some deeples are not swimbles.**\n\n   Let\u2019s think: Does this **necessarily** follow?\n\n   We know:\n   - Deeples and plantles are completely separate.\n   - Some swimbles are plantles \u2192 so those swimbles are **not** deeples (because deeples can\u2019t be plantles).\n   - But what about the **other** swimbles? Maybe all swimbles are plantles? Or maybe some swimbles are not plantles?\n\n   The key point: The conclusion is about **deeples** and whether **some of them are not swimbles**.\n\n   But do we know **anything** about the relationship between deeples and swimbles **directly**?\n\n   We know:\n   - Deeples \u2260 plantles\n   - Some swimbles = plantles \u2192 so those swimbles \u2260 deeples\n\n   But what if **all** deeples **are** swimbles? Is that possible?\n\n   Let\u2019s test that possibility.\n\n   Suppose:\n   - All deeples are swimbles.\n   - But deeples are not plantles.\n   - Some swimbles are plantles (so those are different swimbles).\n\n   Is this consistent?\n\n   Yes!\n\n   Example:\n\n   - Let\u2019s say we have 3 groups:\n     - Deeples: {D1, D2}\n     - Plantles: {P1, P2}\n     - Swimbles: {D1, D2, P1}  \u2192 so some swimbles (P1) are plantles, and all deeples (D1, D2) are swimbles.\n\n   Check premises:\n   - No deeples are plantles \u2192 D1, D2 are not in {P1, P2} \u2192 \u2705\n   - Some swimbles are plantles \u2192 P1 is in both \u2192 \u2705\n\n   Conclusion: \u201cSome deeples are not swimbles\u201d \u2192 But in this case, **all** deeples **are** swimbles \u2192 so the conclusion is **false** in this model.\n\n   Therefore, the conclusion does **not** necessarily follow.\n\n   The conclusion claims that **some deeples are not swimbles**, but we just constructed a scenario where **all deeples are swimbles**, and both premises are still satisfied.\n\n   So the conclusion is **not logically entailed** by the premises.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**The syllogism is incorrect.**\n\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premises. It is possible for all deeples to be swimbles (as long as they are not plantles), while still satisfying both premises.

But what about their relationship to fixbles?\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether any turnles are fixbles or not.

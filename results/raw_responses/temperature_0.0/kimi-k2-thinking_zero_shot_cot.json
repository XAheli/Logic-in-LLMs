(Some S are not W)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze what the premises actually tell us**\n- Premise 1 tells us there is at least one thing that is both a whizzler and crunchy (the W and C circles overlap).\n- Premise 2 tells us that sparkle things and crunchy things are completely separate (the S and C circles do not overlap at all).\n\n**Step 3: Check if the conclusion necessarily follows**\nThe conclusion claims there exists at least one sparkle thing that is not a whizzler. However, the premises do **not** guarantee this. Consider these possibilities:\n\n- **Possibility 1**: No sparkle things exist at all. In this case, the conclusion \"some sparkle things are not whizzlers\" would be false (since there are no sparkle things), but both premises could still be true.\n\n- **Possibility 2**: All sparkle things are whizzlers.

The premises would be true, but the conclusion would be false.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the formal fallacy**\nThis commits the **fallacy of the illicit major**. The major term \"whizzlers\" (W) is distributed in the conclusion (\"some S are **not W**\") but it is not distributed in either premise. In Premise 1 (\"some W are C\"), W is not distributed.\n\n**Conclusion**: Since we can construct scenarios where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the syllogism is invalid.",

The middle term \"weightble\" (W) doesn't connect T and F in a way that allows us to draw a conclusion about them.\n\n3. **Counterexample:**\n   Imagine a scenario where:\n   - All turnles are fixbles (T \u2286 F)\n   - Some fixbles are weightble (as stated)\n   - No turnles are weightble (as stated)\n   \n   In this scenario, both premises are true, but the conclusion \"some turnles are not fixbles\" is **false** (since all turnles are fixbles). This shows the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow.\n\n4. **Venn Diagram Issue:**\n   If we draw the circles, we'd place an X in the F\u2229W area (from Premise 1) and shade the T\u2229W area as empty (from Premise 2). However, the T circle could be entirely inside F, entirely outside F, or partially overlapping - the premises don't tell us. We cannot definitively place an X in the T\u2229\u00acF area as the conclusion requires.\n\n**Conclusion:** The syllogism commits the fallacy of **illicit process** - it attempts to draw a conclusion about a relationship between T and F when the premises only establish relationships with W.
